Before you begin the next lesson,

00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:04.671
there are a few more things to keep in mind.

00:00:04.738 --> 00:00:09.075
The "Title 38 and Hybrid Title 38 Employees" module is made up

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:12.078
of the 11 lessons listed on the screen.

00:00:12.145 --> 00:00:15.048
Apart from this introduction and the module's conclusion,

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:19.319
each lesson covers a single article in the Master Agreement.

00:00:19.386 --> 00:00:22.155
You do not have to take these lessons in order.

00:00:22.222 --> 00:00:26.359
You must review each page of a lesson for it to be marked completed.

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:29.028
If you exit a lesson before completing it,

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:31.865
your page will be bookmarked so you can pick up where you left

00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:34.167
off when you return.

00:00:34.234 --> 00:00:37.337
The instructional content for each of these "article lessons"

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:41.174
will take you an average of three to four minutes to complete.

00:00:41.241 --> 00:00:47.414
So at a minimum, you can expect to complete this module in 33 minutes.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.649
Remember that each lesson will provide you with an opportunity

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:52.185
to read an article in its entirety,

00:00:52.252 --> 00:00:55.588
so be sure to include some time to "read the contract!"

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:58.258
It will take you about 30 minutes to read the 9 articles

00:00:58.324 --> 00:00:59.559
in this module.

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:03.096
Once you have completed all the lessons in "Title 38 and Hybrid

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:07.200
Title 38 Employees," you will be required to take an evaluation

00:01:07.267 --> 00:01:10.437
to earn your Certificate of Completion for the module.

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:13.573
You're now ready to exit this lesson and to begin another one!
