00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:01.935
Before you begin the next lesson,

00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.571
there are a few more things to keep in mind.

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:07.774
The "Counseling, Performance, and Grievances" module is made

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.243
up of the 22 lessons listed on the screen.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:14.247
Apart from this introduction and the module's conclusion,

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:17.784
each lesson covers a single article in the Master Agreement.

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:20.620
You do not have to take these lessons in order.

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:23.957
You must review each page of a lesson for it to be marked completed.

00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:26.793
If you exit a lesson before completing it,

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.596
your page will be bookmarked so you can pick up where you left

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:31.564
off when you return.

00:00:31.631 --> 00:00:34.334
The instructional content for each of these "article lessons"

00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:37.537
will take you an average of 4-5 minutes to complete.

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:41.841
So at a minimum, you can expect to complete this module in a

00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:43.743
about 97 minutes.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.846
Remember that each lesson will provide you with an opportunity

00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:49.082
to read an article in its entirety,

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.552
so be sure to include some time to "read the contract!"

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:55.688
It will take you about two hours and 20 minutes to read the 20

00:00:55.755 --> 00:00:57.891
articles in this module.

00:00:57.957 --> 00:01:00.226
Once you have completed all the lessons in "Counseling,

00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:03.329
Performance, and Grievances," you will be required to take an

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:06.266
evaluation to earn your Certificate of Completion for

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:07.734
the module.

00:01:07.801 --> 00:01:11.137
You're now ready to exit this lesson and to begin another one!
