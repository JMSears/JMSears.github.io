00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:02.635
Whether you are a Master Agreement Practitioner or a

00:00:02.702 --> 00:00:06.139
Bargaining Unit Employee, or whether you see labor-management

00:00:06.206 --> 00:00:08.208
relations as inherently adversarial,

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:12.512
you must keep in mind the VA's mission to serve and honor the

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:16.015
men and women who are America's Veterans.

00:00:16.082 --> 00:00:18.184
When the Master Agreement was negotiated,

00:00:18.251 --> 00:00:21.020
the VA's mission was ever present at the bargaining table.

00:00:21.087 --> 00:00:25.959
As such, management, union officials and employees will

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:29.262
treat each other with respect and dignity.

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:32.499
A constructive and cooperative working relationship is

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:35.468
essential to achieving the Department's mission.
