If you have enrolled in this module,

00:00:02.435 --> 00:00:07.240
then you are likely to be a Supervisor or Department Official at VA.

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:10.009
Or you may work in Human Resources.

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:13.246
Or perhaps in addition to your regular position at VA,

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:15.648
you have taken on the responsibilities of a Union

00:00:15.715 --> 00:00:19.519
Representative for NAGE as either an Officer or a Steward.

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:22.355
For the purposes of this training,

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:25.658
you are considered to be a "Master Agreement Practitioner."

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:28.595
With the knowledge gained by completing the VA-NAGE Master

00:00:28.661 --> 00:00:31.531
Agreement Curriculum, you will be better able to interpret and

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:33.700
provide guidance on the articles,

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:36.936
as well as recognize situations when you might need to reach out

00:00:37.003 --> 00:00:40.740
to other Master Agreement experts for help in using them.
