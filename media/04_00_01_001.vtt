00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:09.642
understanding of some of the articles that are included in

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:14.247
the 2017 Master Agreement by and between the Department of

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:18.151

Government Employees, or NAGE.

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:24.557
The nine articles covered in this module are listed on the screen.

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:28.128
These articles are primarily concerned with how Hybrid Title

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:33.500
38 Employees differ from pure Title 38 Employees and aspects

00:00:33.566 --> 00:00:37.604
of employment for pure Title 38 Employees that include work

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.809
assignments, proficiencies, pay, review boards, and advancement.

00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:46.713
After completing this module, you will be better prepared to

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.649
effectively interpret these articles as they were intended

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:53.453
originally and avoid creating your own intent.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.889
You will then feel more confident in following and

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:59.025
complying with the articles when using them in the field.
