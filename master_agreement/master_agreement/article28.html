<h2>Section 5 - Procedures for WIGI Determinations</h2>

		<ol type="A">
		<li>Where an employee has been assigned a present supervisor for less than 90 days and that supervisor cannot adequately assess the employee's performance, a written evaluation of the employee's performance under the prior supervisor shall be obtained before making a performance determination. A copy of this document will be given to the employee.</li>
		<li>Except in rare and unusual circumstances, the WIGI will be granted as soon as the employee is eligible unless the employee was informed in writing:

				<ol type="1">
				<li>During the most recent progress review; or,</li>
				<li>No later than at least 60 calendar days before the end of the statutory waiting period for eligibility for a WIGI that  his or her performance is not at an acceptable level of competence and unless  his or her performance improves, the WIGI will be denied. </li>
				</ol></li>
				
		<li>In those rare and unusual circumstances when the supervisor does not give 60 calendar days advance notice and the WIGI is delayed, the supervisor will reconsider the employee's level of competence not later than 60 calendar days after the date on which the employee completed the required waiting period. If the employee's level of competence is acceptable, the WIGI will be made retroactively effective on its original due date. </li>
		<li>If at the end of 60 calendar days, the employee's performance is not at an acceptable level of competence for the purpose of approving the WIGI, the employee will be given a written notice which will include:

				<li>A statement that the employee has a right to request, in writing, reconsideration of the negative determination provided the request is made within 15 calendar days of the employee's receipt of the negative determination;</li>
				<li>The name of the reconsideration official to whom an employee may submit a request;</li>
				<li>A statement that the employee may have a Local representative when presenting a request to the reconsideration official;</li>
				<li>A statement that the employee may grieve the reconsideration consistent with Article 40 - Grievance Procedure at the Step 2 Level or Step 3 Level as appropriate; and,</li>
				<li>An explanation that the employee may be considered for a WIGI at any time during the next 26 calendar weeks if the employee demonstrates an acceptable level of competence.</li>
				</ol></li>
		</ol>

<h2>Section 6 - Exceptions</h2>
