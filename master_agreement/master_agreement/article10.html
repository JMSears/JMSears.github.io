The request must include the name(s) of the officer(s)/steward(s), date, time, place of training or orientation session and the subject matters to be covered.  A response to the request will be provided to the Local as soon as practicable, but no later than ten calendar days prior to the training session.  If the Union is unable to provide this advance notice through no fault of their own, the Department may approve this training in the absence of the 21 day notice requirement (i.e., it was impossible to provide the training notice to the Parties within 21 days).</li>
