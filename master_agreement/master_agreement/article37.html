<h1>ARTICLE 37 - DISCIPLINE AND ADVERSE ACTIONS</h1>

<div>

<h2>Section 1 - General </h2>

		<ol type="A">
		<li>It shall be the policy of the Department to effect disciplinary, adverse and major adverse action only for just cause as will promote the efficiency of the service. Disciplinary and adverse actions shall be consistent with the punishable act, the degree of the severity of the act, the employment record of the employee, and the principle of consistency of discipline, so as to promote the efficiency of the Department (meaning the use of like penalties for like offenses).</li>
		<li>Disciplinary and major adverse actions taken against Title 38 employees based on professional conduct or competence, as determined by the Secretary or designee, are outside the scope of bargaining pursuant to 38 USC 7422 and are not governed by this Article.</li>
		<li>Disciplinary procedures, not covered by applicable laws, rules, regulations or this Agreement, can be found in VA Handbook 5021.</li>
		</ol>
</div>
<div>

<h2>Section 2 - Definitions </h2>


<p>For purposes of this Article, the following definitions are used:  </p>

		<ol type="A">
		<li>For Title 5, Title 38 7401(3) Hybrid and Veterans Canteen Service employees: </li>

				<ol type="1">
				<li>A disciplinary action is defined as an admonishment, reprimand, or suspension of 14 calendar days or less; and </li>
				<li>Adverse actions are removals, suspensions (including indefinite suspensions) of more than 14 calendar days, reduction in pay or grade or furloughs of 30 calendar days or less.</li>
				</ol>

				<li>A major adverse action is a suspension (including indefinite suspensions), transfer, reduction in grade, reduction in basic pay or discharge based on conduct or performance.</li>
				</ol>
		</ol>
</div>
<div>

<h2>Section 3 - Removal of Disciplinary Actions</h2>

		<ol type="A">
		<li>Records which meet the requirements for officially approved system of records, consistent with 5 CFR Part 293 - Personnel Records, maintained by department officials must conform to the approved requirements for those records.</li>
		<li>Letters of Admonishment will be removed from the personnel folder after a one year period. Upon the employee's request, an admonishment may be removed after six months if, in the opinion of the supervisor, the letter of admonishment has served its purpose.</li>
		<li>Letters of Reprimand will be removed from the personnel folder after a two year period unless additional occurrences have occurred and then they may be maintained for three years.</li>
		</ol>
</div>
<div>

<h2>Section 4 - Alternative and Progressive Discipline</h2>

		<ol type="A">
		<li>Progressive discipline means using the least severe action which, in the Department's judgment, will correct the employee's misconduct.  Progressive discipline does not preclude the exercise of discretion by the Department in determining appropriate action. The Department will apply progressive discipline when it determines that progressive discipline will correct the misconduct.</li>
		<li>The Department and the Union support the use of alternative approaches to traditional disciplinary actions in certain circumstances. However, alternative discipline will be used only when agreed upon as appropriate by the Department and the employee. If the employee is represented by the Union, the Union must sign off on all alternative discipline. If the employee is not represented by the Union any alternative discipline must comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</li>
		<li>Alternative discipline is defined as any form of action taken to correct behavior other than the traditional disciplinary methods. Alternative discipline provides the opportunity to address employee misconduct in a more positive manner by offering employees options to traditional discipline; examples, include but are not limited to, unpaid off-duty community service, a paper suspension or donation of annual leave to a leave transfer recipient.</li>
		<li>An employee, or his her union representative, may suggest alternative discipline to the deciding official during his or her oral and written response as full settlement of the pending action.</li>
		</ol>
</div>
<div>

<h2>Section 5 - Timeliness of Investigation </h2>

		<ol type="A">
		<li>Consistent with 5 USC 7106(a)(2)(A), the Department:</li>

				<ol type="1">
				<li>Will investigate an incident or situation as soon as possible to determine whether or not discipline is warranted; and,</li>
				<li>Will initiate discipline, if any, within a reasonable amount of time after completion of the investigation.</li>
				</ol>
				
		<li>An employee may have a right to union representation, consistent with Article 7 - Employee Rights and Article 36 - Investigations.</li>
		<li>A reasonable effort will be made to reconcile conflicting statements by developing additional evidence.  In all cases, the information obtained will be documented.</li>
		<li>It may be necessary for the Department to remove an employee from the worksite during the pendency of discipline. In those instances where it is determined that the employee's continued presence at work might pose a threat to employees, patients or the public, result in loss of or damage to VA property, or otherwise jeopardize legitimate Department interests, reassigning the employee must be considered. This includes, but is not limited to, reassignment or detailing the employee to other duties to eliminate concerns arising out of the proposed action.  In such instances: </li>
			
				<ol type="1">
				<li>The Department will take into consideration the impact of the resulting assignment to the employee as well as the relationship between the temporary assignment and their previous work assignment.</li>
				<li>When the Department details or reassigns an employee who is the subject of an investigation, the Department when practicable will detail or reassign the employee to an assignment which will not result in the loss of any benefits, pay or differentials.</li>
 				</ol>
				
		<li>The Department will take into consideration the impact of the resulting assignment to the employee as well as the relationship between the temporary assignment and their previous work assignment.</li>
		<li>If the Department initiates a formal investigation regarding discipline, it will do so consistent with Article 36 - Investigations, Section 3, Formal Investigations.</li>
		</ol>

				<ol type="1">
				<li>Must be absolutely uncirculated, they cannot be reviewed by anyone else (including secretaries, other supervisors, or Department official(s)); and, </li>
				<li>Must be maintained in secure fashion in order to prevent unauthorized disclosure, in accordance with 5 CFR 293.</li>
				</ol>

		<li>Supervisory notes may only be used to support any action detrimental to an employee if such notes have been shown to the employee at the earliest available time after the entry was made and a copy provided to the employee. If a supervisor gives a copy of the note to the employee more than 7 calendar days after the note was created, the supervisor must provide a written explanation why there was a delay in providing the note.
