<h2>Section 6 - Imminent Danger Situations</h2>

		<ol type="A">		
		<li>In accordance with 29 CFR 1960.2(u), the term "imminent danger" means any condition or practice in any workplace which is such that a danger exists which could reasonably be expected to cause death or serious physical harm immediately or before the imminence of such danger can be eliminated through normal procedures. </li>
 		<li>In the case of imminent danger situations, employees shall make reports by the most expeditious means available. The employee has a right to decline to perform his or her assigned tasks because of a reasonable belief that, under the circumstances, the task poses an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm coupled with a reasonable belief that there is insufficient time to effectively seek corrective action through normal hazard reporting and abatement procedures. In these instances, however, the employee must report the situation to a Department official or Safety and Health representative.</li>
		<li>If the condition can be corrected and the corrected condition does not pose an imminent danger, the employee must return to work. If the supervisor cannot correct the condition or does not feel that an imminent danger condition exists, the supervisor shall request an inspection by facility safety and health personnel. While awaiting an inspection and the completion of any repairs resulting from the inspection, the Department may require that the employee perform alternative tasks for which the employee is qualified. </li>
		<li>A Local representative will be given the opportunity to be present during the inspection by the safety and health personnel. The Department shall investigate all instances where safety, health and environment personnel have failed to notify the Local and provide an opportunity to be present during inspections. The Department shall provide the Local with a written explanation stating the reason(s) for such failure and any corrective actions taken. </li>
		<li>If the safety, health and environment personnel decide the condition does not pose an imminent danger, the instruction to return to work shall be in writing and contain a statement declaring the area or assignment to be safe. When the employee is notified of this decision the Local will be notified at the same time. Refusal to perform an assignment after the safety, health and environment personnel has deemed it to be safe may result in disciplinary action. </li>
		<li>When the Department receives a report that a dangerous, unhealthful or potentially dangerous or unhealthful condition is present at a particular work site, the Department shall notify the Safety and Health Committee and the Local Safety, Health and Environment representative(s) of the alleged dangerous or unhealthful conditions. </li>

<h2>Section 16 - Smoking Environmental Hazards</h2>

		<ol type="A">
		<li>The following is being provided for information purposes only: 

				<ol type="1">
				<li>In 1992, Congress passed Public Law 102-585, requiring VHA medical centers, nursing homes and domiciliary care facilities establish smoking areas for patients, and residents, in a way that is consistent with medical requirements and limitations. </li>
				<li>In 1997, Executive Order 13058 established a policy of providing smoke-free environments for Federal employees and members of the public visiting or using Federal facilities.</li>
				<li>In 2006, this evidence was reviewed and published in the United States Surgeon General's Report, "The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke," which reported that “secondhand smoke causes premature death and disease in children and in adults who do not smoke."</li>
				<li>The Parties agree that even though the Department is still required to provide smoking areas for patients and residents, the Parties should work together to create additional measures to further decrease exposure to secondhand smoke for VA patients, residents, employees, visitors and volunteers and to promote tobacco use cessation.</li>
				</ol></li>

		<li>Recognizing tobacco's risk to employees' health and well-being, the Department and the Union mutually support and encourage all efforts by employees to quit tobacco use. The Department, consistent with law, government-wide regulations, this Agreement, and VA policy, specifically VHA Directive 2008-052, or its successor will implement safeguards to prevent smoking, to strengthen existing smoke-free policies and to eliminate environmental hazards in the workplace. </li>
		<li>In the event of a change in law or decision by OPM to mandate hazard pay for exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, the Department will immediately act to ensure employees receive such compensation, consistent with the law or government-wide regulation, as applicable. Additionally, if the change triggers a duty to bargain, the Department will do so, consistent with Article 13 - National Consultation Rights and Mid-term Bargaining. </li>
		<li>An employee who sustains a job related injury or illness may file a claim with the Office of Worker's Compensation consistent with Article 46 - Work Related Injury / Illness.</li>
		<li>Smoking Cessation Program

				<ol type="1">
				<li>Consistent with 5 USC 7901 and OPM guidance, the Department may use appropriated funds to provide Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) and over the counter (OTC) medications at no cost to employees. Programs will include or be similar to programs conducted by the American Lung Association or the American Heart Association.</li>
				<li>VA may provide free NRT and OTC medications to non-VHA employees who seek assistance with quitting smoking. </li>
				<li>Consistent with Handbook 5019 and VHA Directive 2010-041, it is VHA policy to provide free OTC formulations of NRT in appropriate combinations of the nicotine patch, gum and lozenges to employees who are seeking assistance with quitting smoking as part of preventive health initiatives for employees. Regarding VHA employees, a number of VA medical centers have successfully implemented policies to provide free OTC and NRT for employees who are seeking assistance with quitting smoking. These include:

						<ol type="a">
						<li>Providing free OTC and NRT purchased by VA;</li>
						<li>Providing OTC and NRT through an outside vendor;</li>
						<li>Providing free OTC and NRT through existing employee health clinics;</li>
						<li>Providing free OTC and NRT through existing facility tobacco cessation programs;</li>
						<li>Providing vouchers for purchasing OTC and NRT through VA canteens; and,</li>
						<li>Contracting with state or private telephone counseling quit line for services, including OTC and NRT. </li>
						</ol></li>

				<li>Additional procedures not covered in this section including providing smoking cessation services to non-VHA bargaining unit employees and the mechanics of how this is administered, may be negotiated at the local level.</li>

The display is usually considered to include the screen or projection surface and the device that produces the information on the screen. In some computers, the display is packaged in a separate unit called a monitor. </li>
				<li>A CRT is a vacuum tube containing one or more electron guns (a source of electrons or electron emitter) and a fluorescent screen used to view images.</li>
				</ol></li>
		
		<li>The policy of the Department is to provide safe and healthful workplaces for all employees. In keeping with the policy, the Department acknowledges that there are certain ergonomic and environmental factors that can contribute to the health and comfort of VDT users. These factors involve the proper design of workstations and the education of managers, supervisors, and employees about the ergonomic job design and organizational solutions to VDT problems as recommended in various studies published by the NIOSH. </li>
		<li>The Department agrees that employees should be provided information about ergonomic hazards and how to prevent ergonomically related injuries. OSHA Safety and Health Guidelines and other available literature could provide this information. The Department agrees to provide, consistent with VA policy, workstations and equipment (chairs, tables, workstations, lighting, keyboards, screens, and printers, etc.) that meet ergonomic design criteria. It is also agreed that when equipment is purchased, a vendor should provide training on how to safely and properly operate that equipment. </li>
		<li>An employee may request an ergonomic assessment which will identify the employee's needs and the available modifications. Upon request, the Department will meet with the employee and his or her union representative to discuss the assessment and how to proceed. The Department will further achieve this by:

				<ol type="1">
				<li>Lighting:

						<ol type="a">
						<li>An employee's concern about lighting in his or her work location is an appropriate issue to be raised in the ergonomic assessment.</li>
						<li>The Department will place and position computer monitors in work locations so as to avoid unnecessary glare or will allow the use of anti-glare screens, as needed. </li>
						<li>The Department will provide lighting that is adequate and appropriate for the work setting. </li>
						</ol></li>

				<li>Keyboard and Screen:

						<ol type="a">
						<li>An employee's concern about his or her keyboard or computer screen is an appropriate issue to be raised in the ergonomic assessment. </li>
						<li>Keyboards should be placed on a level and stable surface for normal keying function and be adjustable vertically and horizontally to fit the employee's height consistent with the specifications of the ergonomic evaluations.</li>
						<li>Keyboards, in combination with their supporting surface, chairs, carts and other furniture shall permit employees to adopt and maintain neutral wrist positions. </li>
						<li>Screens should be easily adjustable for brightness and field of vision of the employee. </li>
						<li>Employees engaged in continuous computer or keyboard use are encouraged to engage in other work duties on a periodic basis (e.g. hourly) to avoid unnecessary eye or wrist strain. Although not required of the employee, the Parties agree that OSHA recommends employees using VDT's for two hours to take a ten-minute “break" from computer tasks. This can be accomplished by performing duties that do not require the use of a VDT. The Parties agree that this recommendation is not a break in addition to the two, 15 minute breaks in Article 15 - Hours of Work. Where there are prolonged periods of VDT use and no other work tasks available, those employees will approach their supervisor for further instructions on other assignments that can be performed. The Supervisor's determination that non VDT work is unavailable does not remove the responsibility to provide the employee a break from the VDT. </li>
						</ol></li>
						
				<li>Printers:

						<ol type="a">
						<li>The Department will place printers in a manner so that employees do not have to excessively bend, stoop, or reach to remove printed materials. </li>
						<li>Noise exposure related to printers will meet the requirements of 29 CFR 1910.95(b)(1).</li>
						</ol></li>

				<li>Where the levels of such contaminants become health threatening, the Department will either seek to relocate or evacuate the facility. </li>
				</ol></li>

		<li>Microbial Contamination

				<ol type="1">
				<li>The Department agrees to eliminate or control all known sources of microbial contaminants by assessments and appropriate response to all areas where water collection and leakage has occurred, including floors, roofs, HVAC cooling coils, drain pans, humidifiers containing reservoirs of stagnant water, air washers, fan coil units and filters. Such response will normally require prompt cleaning and repair of contaminated areas.</li>
				<li>The Department shall:
				
						<ol type="a">
						<li>Clean and disinfect or remove and discard porous organic materials that are contaminated (e.g., damp insulation in ventilation system, moldy ceiling tiles, and mildewed carpets); and, </li>
						<li>Clean and disinfect nonporous surfaces where microbial growth has occurred with detergents, micro biocides, or other biocides and insuring that these cleaners have been removed before air handling units are turned on. </li>
