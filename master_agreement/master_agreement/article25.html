<h2>Section 2 - General </h2>

		<ol type="A">
		<li>Details are intended only for the needs of the Department's work requirements when necessary services cannot be obtained by other desirable or practicable means. Consistent with 5 USC 7106, 5 CFR Part 335, Subpart (a) general provisions, VA Handbook 5005, the Department determines the qualifications for a detail or temporary promotion and which employees meet those qualifications.</li>
		<li>Details of one week or more shall be recorded and maintained in the employees' personnel record.</li>
		<li>Assignment of Title 38 employees is a matter of professional conduct or competence, in that it involves direct patient care and clinical competence (e.g., specific competencies of individual employees on duty in a given unit at a given time may impact the quality of patient care available on that unit). Accordingly, the following provisions must be read consistently with the exemptions from collective bargaining provided by 38 USC 7422(b) and to allow for exceptions, within the Department's sole discretion, to meet patient care needs.</li>
		<li>Subject to the Department's reserved rights under 5 USC 7106(a)(2) and 38 USC 7422(b), the following procedures shall apply when offering noncompetitive details of more than one and up to 60 days to both classified and unclassified positions:</li>

				<ol type="1">
				<li>The Department will canvass the qualified employees to determine if anyone wishes to be detailed, if the same number of volunteers as vacancies exists, they shall be selected.</li>
				<li>If more employees volunteer than vacancies exist, the Department will select from the qualified volunteers. Seniority, as defined in Article 60 - Seniority, will be the selection criterion.</li>
				<li>If no employee volunteers, then the least senior qualified employee will be selected.</li>
				<li>If there are fewer volunteers than vacancies, then the volunteers will be selected and additional persons will be selected as in D2 above, the Department will notify the Local of all details.</li>
				<li>Pursuant to this section, if a subsequent detail is required the Department will rotate the detail among qualified employees based on reverse seniority from a list of qualified employees who have not served on a detail.</li>
				<li>Additional procedures and processes for details not addressed in this Article are subjects for local negotiations.</li>
				</ol>

		<li>Details outside of the duty station or work site if different than the duty station the Department shall accomplish a case-by-case analysis comparing the distance from the old duty station or work site to the employee's residence with the distance from the new duty station to the employee's residence. When a significant difference exists, the employee should be given duty time for travels commensurate with the new duty station or work site.</li>
		<li>All procedures and processes, either in this Article or negotiated at the local level consistent with the provisions in this Article, for details, reassignments and temporary promotions, shall be administered in a fair and equitable manner.</li>
		</ol>
</div>

<h2>Section 3 - Temporary Promotions - Title 5 and Hybrid Title 38</h2>

		<ol type="A">
		<li>Employees detailed to a higher-graded position for a period of more than 10 consecutive workdays must be temporarily promoted. The employee will be paid for the temporary promotion beginning the first day of the detail. The temporary promotion should be initiated at the earliest date it is known by the Department that the detail is expected to exceed 10 consecutive workdays.</li>
		<li>The 10 consecutive workday provision will not be circumvented by rotating employees into a higher-graded position for less than 10 days in order to avoid the higher rate of pay.</li>
		<li>For the purposes of this section, a General Schedule employee who performs the grade controlling duties of a higher-graded position for at least 25% of the time, or a Wage Grade employee who performs higher graded duties on a regular and recurring basis, shall be temporarily promoted.</li>
		<li>Temporary promotions in excess of 60 calendar days shall be filled through competitive procedures. Temporary promotions of less than 60 days shall be made in accordance with Section 1.</li>
