<h2>Section 2 - Promotion and Reconsideration</h2>

		<ol type="A">
		<li>The promotion eligibility and subsequent reconsideration process for Hybrid Title 38 employees appointed under 38 USC 7401(3) and 38 USC 7405(a)(1)(B) is made under the Department's promotion and reconsideration process pursuant to VHA Handbook 5005 Part III, Chapter 4 and the provisions of 38 USC 7403.

				<ol type="1">
				<li>Promotion actions will be taken without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, age, sexual orientation, labor affiliation or non-affiliation, status as a parent, or any other non-merit factor, and shall be based solely on job-related criteria.</li>
				<li>Qualification standards for individuals appointed under 38 USC 7401(3) are based primarily on the rank-in-person concept, where the combination of individuals' accomplishments, performance and qualifications determine their grade level. For assignments above the full-performance level, the higher-level duties must consist of significant scope, complexity (difficulty), and range of variety, and be performed by the incumbent at least 25% of the time. </li>
				<li>The Department will issue copies of their respective occupation qualification standards to hybrid employees at the time of initial appointment and at the time of a newly published standard.</li>

<h2>Section 3 - Promotion Eligibility At Or Below the Full Performance Level</h2>

		<ol type="A">	
		<li>For occupations covered by these guidelines, the full performance (journey) level may vary depending on the complexities of the assignment or the competencies possessed by the individual and are not dependent on the entry level grade of the occupation. In this rank-in- person system, the promotion potential of positions may not be limited to grades below the full performance level as identified in the qualification standard. </li>
		<li>The employee shall be notified of eligibility for promotion consideration on his or her anniversary date and be given 30 days to submit to the employee's supervisor a self-assessment of his or her qualifications for promotion consideration. Employees may also notify their supervisor in writing that they are declining to submit a self-assessment during this 30 day period. </li>
		<li>Upon receipt of the employee's self-assessment, the supervisor will make a recommendation on promotion that is to be acted upon by the approving official within 30 days of the self-assessment being received. Promotions will become effective on the first day of the first full pay period following approval by the second level supervisor. In no case will the promotion be effected later than the first day of the first full pay period commencing 60 days after the employee's anniversary date. </li>
		<li>Employees who have not demonstrated such capability will be informed in writing by the supervisor that they are not being recommended for promotion. The written notice will state the reason(s) why the employee does not meet the criteria for promotion. Upon request, the supervisor, or designee, will meet with the employee and provide clarification of the qualification standards not met. The supervisor may recommend the employee for promotion at a later date if it is determined that the employee has met the appropriate criteria. If not promoted during the intervening period, the employee is entitled to promotion consideration on the next anniversary date of grade.</li>
		</ol>
</div>
<div>

<h2>Section 4 - Promotion Eligibility Above the Full Performance Level</h2>

		<ol type="A">
		<li>Employees who are eligible for promotion consideration to a grade that requires a combination of personal qualifications and assignment characteristics are to be considered for promotion to such grades on the first anniversary date of their last promotion, provided they meet the administrative requirements. In addition, employees who are selected for supervisory or managerial assignments or for assignments based on complexity that warrant consideration for a higher grade will be considered for promotion on a date other than the anniversary date of last promotion. The employee's anniversary date is the date of appointment or date of last promotion. If an employee is unable to access his or her anniversary date on the respective service screen, the anniversary date will be provided to the employee in writing by the Department. </li>
		<li>If, after reviewing the employee's self-assessment (if submitted), and other relevant material, the appropriate department official (e.g., service chief) determines that the assignment does not meet the qualification standard for a higher grade, that official shall document the reasons for this determination in writing and provide a copy of the determination to the employee.</li>
		<li>When a revised qualification standard is implemented that gives a facility discretion to fill or not fill a position(s) under position management, it shall be done under the requirement to keep functional statements accurate and in accordance with Article 26 - Merit Promotion in which all Hybrid Title 38 employees in the facility who are qualified for the position(s) will have equal consideration for promotion. </li>
		</ol>

				<li>Second level supervisors are to review the employee's request within 30 days and determine whether to promote the employee. If a second level supervisor determines that a promotion is not warranted, the supervisor will provide the reasons for this decision to the employee in writing. </li>
