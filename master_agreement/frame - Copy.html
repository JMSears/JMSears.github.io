	<p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;">2 . A display is a computer output surface and projecting mechanism that shows text and often graphic images to the computer user, using a cathode ray tube (CRT), liquid crystal display (LCD), light-emitting diode, gas plasma, or other image projection technology . The display is usually considered to include the screen or projection surface and the device that produces the information on the screen . In some computers, the display is packaged in a separate unit called a monitor .</p>

	<p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">A . Consistent with EO 12564, VA Handbook 5383, and applicable government- wide regulations, reasonable suspicion testing may be required of any employee in any position which is designated for random testing when there is a reasonable suspicion that the employee uses illegal drugs whether on or off duty . Reasonable suspicion testing may also be required of any employee in any position when there is a reasonable suspicion of on-duty use or on-duty impairment . A reasonable suspicion of drug use or impairment may be based upon, among other things:</p>
	<p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 120pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;">1 . Observable phenomena, such as direct observation of drug use or possession or the physical symptoms of being under the influence of a drug;</p>
	<p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 120pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;">2 . A pattern of abnormal conduct or erratic behavior in the workplace setting indicative of illegal drug use;</p>
	<p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 120pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: justify;">3 . Arrest or conviction for a drug related offense, or the identification of an employee as the focus of a criminal investigation into illegal drug possession, or use or trafficking;</p>
	<p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 120pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;">4 . Written information provided either by reliable and credible source or by an independently corroborated source; or</p>
	<p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 120pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;">5 . Newly discovered evidence that the employee has tampered with a previous drug test .</p>
	<p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark1272">B . The decision to test an employee based upon reasonable suspicion of drug use requires review by a higher-level supervisor . The higher-level supervisor shall advise the supervisor in writing of concurrence or rejection of the decision</a></p>
	<p style="padding-left: 100pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">in advance of the drug test . Furthermore, the supervisor must document in writing all reasons for claiming reasonable suspicion prior to ordering the employee to take the drug test . This includes documentation of information addressed in paragraph 4A above .</p>

	<p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">A . VA is committed to providing a safe and secure work environment . It also has a legitimate interest in determining the cause of serious accidents so that</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">it can take appropriate corrective measures . Post-accident drug testing can provide invaluable information in furtherance of that interest . Accordingly, employees may be subject to testing when, based upon the circumstances of the accident, their actions are reasonably suspected of having caused or contributed to an accident that meets the following criteria:</p>
	<p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;">1 . The accident results in a death or personal injury requiring immediate hospitalization; or</p>
	<p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;">2 . The accident results in damage to government or private property estimated to be in excess of $10,000 .</p>
	<p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">B . If an employee is suspected of having caused or contributed to an accident meeting the above criteria, an appropriate management official will present the facts leading to this decision to the facility Director or designee for approval . Once approval has been obtained and arrangement made for testing, the appropriate Department official will prepare a written report detailing the facts and circumstances that warranted the testing .</p>

Participation or non-participation in voluntary testing will neither advantage nor disadvantage employees in any aspect of their employment except as otherwise agreed to in a settlement or</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 49pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">last chance agreement . To the extent that random testing may be conducted on volunteers, it must be conducted in accordance with applicable laws, rules and regulations .</p>

The Parties agree that methods and equipment used to test for abuse of drugs yield the best results when the most reliable laboratories are used . Therefore, the Department will agree to review the Federal Register to ensure that its contractor remains an HHS-certified laboratory . In the event that the contractor is decertified in accordance with HHS guidelines, the Department will cease any further testing at the decertified laboratory . The Department will also cease further collections until an HHS-certified laboratory is available to accept employee specimens .</a></p>
	<p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 64pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">B . The following procedures will be utilized subject to law, rules and regulations, to ensure drug testing is reliable and employee concerns are recognized:</p>

	<p style="padding-left: 120pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">with the primary specimen for storage in accordance with Chain of Custody Procedures . The split sample will be retained in an appropriate, refrigerated, and secure storage facility in accordance with HHS guidelines for a period of no longer than 15 days . The cost of conducting the split sample, the materials, postage, and storage costs are the responsibility of the Department .</p>
	<p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 136pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">a . Upon notification of a positive confirmatory test from the Department contractor, the MRO will notify the employee and he or she will have the opportunity to provide any/all relevant information that will assist the MRO in determining whether the positive test result is justified .</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 136pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At the employee’s request, the MRO will request the split specimen be tested at an HHS-certified laboratory for the presence of drug(s) for which a positive result was obtained in the test of the primary specimen . The employee shall select a laboratory from a list of three</p>
	<p style="padding-left: 136pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">HHS-certified laboratories . The Department will make the list available to the employee .</p>
	<p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 136pt;text-indent: -15pt;text-align: left;">b .

If a sufficient volume of urine is not available to be provided in a reasonable period of time in accordance with HHS Guidelines, the collection site person will contact an appropriate authority within the Department .

	<p style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 84pt;text-indent: -21pt;text-align: left;">8 .

Upon receipt of a positive test result resulting from the gas chromatography/mass spectrometry confirmatory test conducted by the HHS-certified laboratory, the MRO, in accordance with HHS Guidelines, will examine alternate medical explanations for the test results . If the MRO concludes that the employee’s medical documentation does not provide a legitimate medical explanation for the positive test result, the MRO must explain the basis for his/her rejection of the documentation in writing for the benefit of the employee . If the MRO determines that there is a legitimate medical explanation for the positive test result, he/she will determine that the result is consistent with legal drug use and will take no further action . The test result reported back to the Department would be “negative.”</a></p>
