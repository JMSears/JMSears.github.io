##### 2. License Type
2.1 Subscription or Term License: Under the terms of a Subscription, or Term
License, the Software is licensed only for the period of time set forth in the
Order Form. The Subscription, or Term License is in combination with the other
license types set forth herein thereby limiting the use of the Software to
such applicable license type for the period of time for the applicable
subscription or term. The Subscription, or Term License begins on the date the
Software is delivered and continues for the subscription or term specified in

then the term is twelve (12) months. The Subscription, or Term License will
terminate if Licensee fails to comply with any term or condition in this
Agreement, including failure to pay associated fees when due. Software with a
Subscription, or Term License may contain a device that limits Software usage
in accordance with the license. Duplication or reuse of the Software after

use and altered in order to update or refresh for the same purpose as
originally designed but may not be duplicated in order to create a new
Product. All licensing of Software is non-perpetual.

every twelve (12) months, Licensee will permit Licensor to review and verify
Licensee's deployment and use of the Software for compliance with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, at Licensor's expense. Any such review shall
be scheduled at least ten (10) days in advance, shall be conducted during
normal business hours at Licensee's facilities, and shall not unreasonably
interfere with Licensee's business activities. Within ten (10) days of any
review or certification that finds Licensee's use of the Software to be
greater than that licensed, Licensee will either (i) provide Licensor an Order
Form for the applicable number of additional licenses and pay all applicable
fees in accordance herewith or (ii) certify that such Software has been purged
and removed from Licensee's systems.

2.4 Restrictions. Licensee's use of the Software is limited to the number of
units and such other usage restrictions as are set forth on an Order Form and
as set forth herein. Licensor and its suppliers reserve any and all rights,
implied or otherwise, which are not expressly granted to Licensee hereunder,
and retain all rights, title and interest in and to the Software. Licensee

environment, or in any commercial time share arrangement. Licensee may not use
the Software in contravention to any applicable laws or government
regulations. Licensee shall not decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse
engineer the Software. If the immediately foregoing provision is prohibited by

notice of any such intention to reverse engineer the Software and shall
provide Licensor with a right of first refusal to perform such work at rates
equal to those proposed by a recognized third-party software services provider
for such work. Licensee shall take all reasonable precautions to prevent
unauthorized or improper use or disclosure of the Software.

2.5 The provision of source code, if included with the Software, does not
constitute transfer of any legal rights to such code, and resale or
distribution of all or any portion of all source code and intellectual
property is strictly prohibited hereunder. All Software and other files remain
Licensor's exclusive property. If source code or modifiable files are
provided, regardless of any modifications that Licensee makes, Licensee may
not redistribute them unless Licensor has expressly designated these as re-
distributable, such as with a Product.

2.6 Licensee may not export the Software into any country prohibited by the
United States Export Administration Act and the regulations thereunder.
Licensee acknowledges that the export of any Software is subject to export or
import control and Licensee agrees that any Software or the direct or indirect
product thereof will not be imported or exported (or re-exported from a
country of origin) directly or indirectly, unless Licensee obtains all
necessary licenses from the U.S. Department of Commerce or other applicable
agency or governmental body as required under applicable law. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, Licensee agrees that the Software is
prohibited for export or re-export to Cuba, North Korea, Iran, Libya, Syria
and Sudan or to any person or entity on the U.S. Department of Commerce Denied
Persons List or on the U.S. Department of Treasury's lists of Specially
Designated Nationals, Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers or Specially
Designated Terrorists, as such is changed from time to time.

2.7 In the event that Licensee breaches this EULA, Licensor may terminate the
license, whereupon Licensee must destroy all copies of the Software, with all
other rights and obligations of both parties and all other provisions of this
EULA surviving any such termination.

##### 3. Support Services
3.1 During a Support Services Period, Licensor will provide Licensee with
Support Services, including Updates, to the extent such services are provided
for in the applicable Term, all in accordance with Licensee's Product Support
Program as it exists from time to time. Support Services are provided to
Licensee's designated representatives for the current release of the Software
and all other releases whose version number begins with either the same number
or the previous number left of the left most dot ("."). If and when reasonably
requested by Licensee, Licensee shall provide the necessary access to
Licensee's systems and Software for Licensor to perform the Support Services
hereunder. Licensor may use technical information provided by Licensee
relating to the Software as part of the Support Services, including for
product support and development. If Licensor provides support for earlier
versions of the Software, such support will be treated, billed, and paid for,
as professional services. Licensor makes no representation or warranty that
all bugs will be fixed or all Software will be updated. In addition, as part
of the Support Services, Licensor may make available bug lists, planned
feature lists, and other supplemental materials. Licensor makes no
representations or warranties of any kind for these materials.

##### 4. Fees and Payments
4.1 Licensee shall pay Licensor the fees, charges and other amounts specified
in an Order Form in accordance with the terms of such Order Form. To the
extent such fees are required to be paid up front, Licensee shall pay such
fees in accordance with the instructions provided in such requirement. In the
event the Order Form or Reseller paperwork does not provide for the terms for
the payment of such fees, Licensee shall pay Licensor the fees, charges and
other amounts set forth in the applicable Order Form within thirty (30) days
of the date of invoice. Licensor is expressly authorized by Licensee to ship
the Software upon execution of the applicable Order Form and, to the extent
applicable, to invoice any applicable fees, charges or other amounts upon
delivery. To the extent such fees are not required to be paid up front,
Licensee shall provide a purchase order or notice that a purchase order is not
required for purchase or payment prior to the shipment of any Software or the
provision of any Support Services. Overdue balances are subject to a service
charge equal to the lesser of 1.5% per month or the maximum legal interest
rate allowed by law. Other than as specifically provided herein, Licensee will
not be entitled to a refund of amounts paid for the license to use the
Software or services provided, or any other amounts for any reason. Licensee
shall be responsible for taxes levied on any transaction under this Agreement,
including all federal, state, and local taxes, levies and assessments,
excluding any tax based on Licensor's income.

##### 5. Confidentiality and Data Privacy
5.1 Confidential Information. During the term of this Agreement, each party
will regard any information provided to it by the other party and designated
in writing as proprietary or confidential to be confidential ("Confidential
Information"). Confidential Information shall also include information which,
to a reasonable person familiar with the disclosing party's business and the
industry in which it operates, is of a confidential or proprietary nature. A
party will not disclose the other party's Confidential Information to any
third party without the prior written consent of the other party, nor make use
of any of the other party's Confidential Information except in its performance
under this Agreement. Each party accepts responsibility for the actions of its
agents or employees and shall protect the other party's Confidential
Information in the same manner as it protects its own valuable confidential
information, but in no event shall less than reasonable care be used. The
parties expressly agree that the Software and the terms and pricing of this
Agreement are the Confidential Information of Licensor. Licensee will not
remove or destroy any proprietary markings or restrictive legends placed upon
or contained in the Software. A receiving party shall promptly notify the
disclosing party upon becoming aware of a breach or threatened breach
hereunder, and shall cooperate with any reasonable request of the disclosing
party in enforcing its rights.

5.2 Exclusions. Information will not be deemed Confidential Information
hereunder if such information: (i) is known prior to receipt from the
disclosing party, without any obligation of confidentiality; (ii) becomes
known to the receiving party directly or indirectly from a source other than
one having an obligation of confidentiality to the disclosing party; (iii)
becomes publicly known or otherwise publicly available, except through a
breach of this Agreement; or (iv) is independently developed by the receiving
party. The receiving party may disclose Confidential Information pursuant to
the requirements of applicable law, legal process or government regulation,
provided that it gives the disclosing party reasonable prior written notice to
permit the disclosing party to contest such disclosure, and such disclosure is
otherwise limited to the required disclosure.

5.3 Data Privacy: The terms and conditions of Licensor Privacy Policy are set
out in full at http://www.instructusmedia.com/privacy/ and are incorporated by
reference into this Agreement. By Licensee's acceptance of the terms of this
EULA or use of the Software, Licensee authorizes the collection, use and
disclosure of information collected by Licensor for the purposes provided for
in this Agreement in accordance with the Privacy Policy as revised from time
to time. International users understand and consent to the processing of
personal information in the United States for the purposes described herein in
accordance with the Privacy Policy.


##### 6. Ownership
6.1 Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, Licensor and its suppliers
retain all right, title and interest, including all copyright and intellectual
property rights, in and to, the Software (as an independent work and as an
underlying work serving as a basis for any improvements, modifications,
derivative works, and applications Licensee may develop), and all copies
thereof. All rights not specifically granted in this EULA, including Federal
and international copyrights, are reserved by Licensor and its suppliers.

##### 7. Limited Warranty
7.1 The Software for which Licensor provides no remedies or warranties,
Licensor warrants that (a) it has the right to grant Licensee the license to
use the Software as set out in this Agreement; (b) the Software and the medium
on which it was originally provided is free from any virus at the time of
delivery; ( c) for a period of thirty (30) days following the initial delivery
of the Software to Licensee (the "Warranty Period"), the Software will perform
in conformity with its Documentation; and (d) any Support Services will be
provided with reasonable skill and care conforming to generally accepted
software industry standards.

7.2 EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN THE FOREGOING LIMITED WARRANTY, LICENSOR AND ITS
SUPPLIERS DISCLAIM ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND REPRESENTATIONS, WHETHER EXPRESS,
IMPLIED, OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND TITLE OR QUIET ENJOYMENT.
LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE IS ERROR-FREE OR WILL OPERATE
WITHOUT INTERRUPTION. NO RIGHTS OR REMEDIES REFERRED TO IN ARTICLE 2A OF THE
UCC WILL BE CONFERRED ON LICENSEE UNLESS EXPRESSLY GRANTED HEREIN. THE
SOFTWARE IS NOT DESIGNED, INTENDED OR LICENSED FOR USE IN HAZARDOUS
ENVIRONMENTS REQUIRING FAIL-SAFE CONTROLS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE
DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, MAINTENANCE OR OPERATION OF NUCLEAR FACILITIES, AIRCRAFT
NAVIGATION OR COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS, AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL, AND LIFE SUPPORT OR
WEAPONS SYSTEMS. LICENSOR SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR SUCH PURPOSES.

7.3 No oral or written information or advice given by Licensor, its Resellers,
dealers, distributors, agents, representatives or employees shall create any
warranty or in any way increase any warranty provided herein.

7.4 Licensee's exclusive remedy for Licensor's breach of 7.1(a) above, is that
Licensor will, at its expense, defend and hold Licensee harmless from any suit
or claim brought against Licensee by a third party and will indemnify Licensee
against any third party damage claims that the Software as delivered by
Licensor infringes any third party's intellectual property rights enforceable
under United States law or international copyright treaty, provided Licensee:
(a) promptly notify Licensor after learning of the suit or claim; (b) give
Licensor the authority to defend or settle the suit or claim (provided that
Licensor does not agree to any settlement that requires Licensee to pay money
or make any admissions); and ( c) give Licensor all available non-privileged
information and assistance reasonably requested by Licensor concerning the
suit or claim. If the Software is held or is reasonably believed by Licensor
to be held to infringe any third party rights, Licensor may at its expense,
modify or replace the applicable Software to be non-infringing with similar
functionality, or obtain permission for Licensee to continue using the
Software as permitted under the Agreement, or if neither option is
commercially feasible then to refund that portion of the fees paid in respect
of the applicable product which portion is equal to such fees depreciated in a
straight line over three (3) years from the date of delivery.

7.5 Licensee's exclusive remedy for Licensor breach of 7.1( c) and 7.1(d), is
that Licensor will, at its option and at no cost to Licensee, (a) provide
remedial services necessary to enable the Software or Support Services to
conform to the warranty, or (b) replace any defective Software or media, or
( c) refund amounts paid in respect of the defective Software or Support
Services. Licensor's warranty obligations will only extend (i) to material
errors that can be demonstrated to exist in an unmodified version of the
Software except where the modifications were carried out by Licensor or with
its written approval and (ii) in respect of alleged breaches for which
Licensor has received written notice within the Warranty Period, if
applicable. Licensee will provide Licensor with a reasonable opportunity to
remedy any breach and reasonable assistance in remedying any defects.

7.6 If applicable law requires any warranties other than the foregoing, all
such warranties are limited in duration to thirty (30) days from the date of
delivery. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties,
so the above exclusion may not apply to Licensee. The warranty provided herein
gives Licensee specific legal rights and Licensee may also have other legal
rights that vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. The limitations or
exclusions of warranties, remedies or liability contained in this EULA shall
apply to Licensee only to the extent such limitations or exclusions are
permitted under the laws of the jurisdiction where Licensee is located.

##### 8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
8.1 NEITHER LICENSOR NOR ITS SUPPLIERS SHALL BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY
THIRD PARTY FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, COVER OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR THE
INABILITY TO USE EQUIPMENT OR ACCESS DATA, LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF PROFITS,
BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR THE LIKE), ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO
USE, THE SOFTWARE AND BASED ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY INCLUDING BREACH OF
CONTRACT, BREACH OF WARRANTY, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY
OR OTHERWISE, EVEN IF LICENSOR OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND EVEN IF A REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO
HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. LICENSOR's TOTAL LIABILITY TO LICENSEE
FOR ACTUAL DAMAGES FOR ANY CAUSE WHATSOEVER WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT PAID
BY LICENSEE OR RESELLER, IF ORDERED THROUGH A RESELLER, FOR THE SOFTWARE THAT
CAUSED SUCH DAMAGE. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS DO NOT APPLY TO LICENSOR'S
OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTIONS 5.1 AND 7.4.

8.2 The Limited Warranty and Limitation of Liability set forth above are
fundamental elements of the basis of the agreement between Licensor and
Licensee. Licensor and its suppliers would not be able to provide the Software
on an economic basis without such limitations.

##### 9. TERM AND TERMINATION
9.1 The Term of this Agreement shall be in accordance with the License Type
set forth in Section 2 hereof and any provisions of the applicable Order Form,
subject to earlier termination as provided herein. Except as otherwise
specified in the applicable Order Form, all Support Services shall
automatically renew for a Support Services Period equal to the expiring
period, unless one party gives the other notice of non-renewal at least 45
days before the end of the then-current Support Services Period.

9.2 This Agreement or an individual license granted hereunder may be
terminated (a) by mutual agreement of Licensor and Licensee, (b) by either
party if the other party is adjudicated as bankrupt, or if a petition in
bankruptcy is filed against the other party and such petition is not
discharged within sixty (60) days of such filing, or ( c) by either party if
the other party materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure such
breach to such party's reasonable satisfaction within thirty (30) days
following receipt of written notice thereof. Upon any termination of this
Agreement or a license granted hereunder, all applicable licenses are revoked
and Licensee shall immediately cease use of the applicable Software and
certify in writing to Licensor within thirty (30) days after termination that
such Software and all copies thereof have been destroyed, purged or returned
to Licensor. Termination of this Agreement or a license granted hereunder
shall not limit either party from pursuing any remedies available to it,
including injunctive relief, or relieve Licensee of Licensee's obligation to
pay all fees that have accrued, have been paid, or have become payable
hereunder. All provisions of this Agreement which by their nature are intended
to survive the termination of this Agreement (including, without limitation,
the provisions of Sections 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 11) shall survive such
termination.

##### 10. U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS LEGEND
10.1 This Section 10 applies to all acquisitions of the Software by or for the

disclosure by the Government or any of its authorized users is subject to
restrictions as set forth in this standard license agreement for the Software.
If for any reason, Sections 12.212, 227.7202-1 or 227.7202-3 are deemed not

U.S.A., without giving effect to principles of conflict of laws. Licensee
hereby consents to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the state courts

use Licensee's name and any of Licensee's trade names and trademarks solely in
connection with the rights granted to Licensor pursuant to this marketing
section.

11.4 Neither party may assign any of its rights or obligations hereunder,
whether by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of
the other party (not to be unreasonably withheld). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, either party may assign this Agreement in its entirety (including
all Order Forms), without consent of the other party, to its Affiliate or in
connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of
all or substantially all of its assets. Subject to the foregoing, this

order or other written notification or document issued by Licensee in relation
to the Software licensed hereunder shall be of no effect. The failure or delay
of Licensor to exercise any of its rights under this EULA or upon any breach
of this EULA shall not be deemed a waiver of those rights or of the breach.

amendment to this EULA.

11.7 If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent

maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions of this Agreement will
remain in full force and effect.
