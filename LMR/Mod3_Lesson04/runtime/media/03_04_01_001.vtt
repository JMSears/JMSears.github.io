Article 21 defines competencies as descriptions of the

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.073
appropriate skills that the Department assesses to determine

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.509
an employee's competence.

00:00:09.576 --> 00:00:12.579
This kind of assessment ensures that an employee is proficient

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:16.216
in performing tasks required by his or her position.

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:20.086
Sometimes, an Employee encounters a task that he or she

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:23.990
does not normally perform and is unsure whether he or she is

00:00:24.057 --> 00:00:26.292
competent to perform it.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.397
Article 21 has provisions for the Employee who is unsure of a

00:00:30.463 --> 00:00:32.599
competency-related task.
