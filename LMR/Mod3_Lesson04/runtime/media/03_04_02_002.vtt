00:00:00.266 --> 00:00:03.870
Article 21 explains two ways an Employee can ensure that he or

00:00:03.937 --> 00:00:07.307
she is proficient in the competencies needed to perform

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:09.409
in his or her position.

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:13.046
The Employee can request a competency review or request

00:00:13.113 --> 00:00:14.080
remedial training.

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:18.017
How does a competency review work?

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:20.754
Maria has worked in her position for a few years.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.224
Today, she is required to perform a task she does not

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.292
ordinarily perform.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.064
Maria is concerned that she is not competent to perform the task.

00:00:31.131 --> 00:00:34.401
Article 21 has options for Maria.

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:37.570
Maria can inform her Supervisor that she thinks the task might

00:00:37.637 --> 00:00:41.241
not be relevant to her position and request a Department review

00:00:41.307 --> 00:00:44.611
of the competency associated with the task.

00:00:44.677 --> 00:00:47.046
An appropriate Department Official will determine if the

00:00:47.113 --> 00:00:51.484
review is necessary and provide written feedback to Maria.

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:54.654
Maria can then request that the written feedback be placed in

00:00:54.721 --> 00:00:56.790
the competency file at her workplace.

00:00:56.856 --> 00:01:01.261
This documentation may save time in the future for a Supervisor

00:01:01.327 --> 00:01:02.495
or Employee.
