Article 21 requires the Department to document the

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:07.841
established competencies for an Employee's position in writing.

00:00:07.907 --> 00:00:10.577
The Department is also required to provide a copy of these

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:14.848
competencies to an Employee when he or she enters a position,

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:16.816
or when these competencies are updated.

00:00:16.883 --> 00:00:21.855
Article 21 also grants Local Unions the right to request and

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:24.958
receive copies of competencies.

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:27.894

00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:31.097
change triggers a duty to bargain under the Statute,

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:35.301
the Department will give notice and bargain per Article 13.
