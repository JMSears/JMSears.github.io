<h1>ARTICLE 43 - SEXUAL HARASSMENT</h1>

<h2>Section 1 </h2>

		<ol type="A">
		<li>Sexual harassment is a form of employee misconduct and discrimination, which undermines the integrity of the employment relationship.

Additionally, the Parties do not tolerate or condone any form of harassment or retaliation towards employees who report incidents of harassing behavior or assist in any inquiry about such a report.  The goal of the Department is to create a work environment free from sexual harassment and be in full compliance with law, government-wide regulations and Department policies, including but not limited to VHA Directive 2009-071.</li>
