Local training activities will be established pursuant to the Department's mission, strategic goals and training programs. If the facility makes a change to its training committee which triggers a duty to bargain under the Statute, it will provide notice and bargain consistent with Article 13 - National Consultation Rights and Mid-term Bargaining.</li>
