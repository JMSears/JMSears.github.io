		<li>Any local agreements and/or past practices in effect when this Agreement is signed shall remain in effect, until and unless changed through local bargaining consistent with this Agreement. </li>
		<li>When the Department changes working conditions regarding staff lounges or other similar space and lockers or other similar storage space and a duty to bargain is triggered under the Statute, the Union will be given notice and an opportunity to bargain consistent with Article 13 - National Consultation Rights and Mid-Term Bargaining.
