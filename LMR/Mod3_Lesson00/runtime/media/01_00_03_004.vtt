The VA-NAGE Master Agreement Curriculum will provide you with

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.474
a foundational understanding, but it won't make you an expert!

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.076
The Chief Negotiators tried to construct language with

00:00:10.143 --> 00:00:14.714
procedures so that it is easier to follow and avoid grievances.

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:17.817
If the language is clear, you should find it easier to avoid

00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:21.121
creating your own intent when reading the Master Agreement.

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:25.058
However, even after doing your best to figure it out,

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:27.560
you may find yourself needing help when you are in the field.

00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:31.030
Especially for those articles that require challenging legal

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:34.601
analysis or have numerous other hierarchy items that you should

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:36.302
read in conjunction with an article.

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:40.306
If you feel that the language of an article is unclear and you

00:00:40.373 --> 00:00:43.877
cannot understand it, or if your attempts with the other Party to

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:46.880
resolve differences at the lowest possible level and

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:49.382
acceptable solutions have failed.

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.652
Then the best course of action is to speak with those who've

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.989
negotiated the Master Agreement rather than an individual who is

00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:58.825
not at the bargaining table to come up with his or her

00:00:58.892 --> 00:01:01.261
subjective attempt at the language.
