You cannot truly understand the contract unless you read it in its entirety.

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:06.873
To encourage you in this endeavor,

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.476
this training will provide opportunities to read through

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:13.246
each article and then check yourself on your ability and

00:00:13.313 --> 00:00:15.248
confidence to recall its contents.

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:19.719
For example, the "Read the Contract" exercise allows you to

00:00:19.786 --> 00:00:23.890
read an article, as well as any other articles related to it.

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:26.826
Because the Master Agreement does not stand alone,

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:29.696
you will have the opportunity to read the article's references

00:00:29.763 --> 00:00:31.931
that should be read in conjunction with it,

00:00:31.998 --> 00:00:36.269
such as laws, regulations, or VA Policy.

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:39.906
These references when combined with an article are necessary to

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:43.343
fully understand the context of the Master Agreement.
