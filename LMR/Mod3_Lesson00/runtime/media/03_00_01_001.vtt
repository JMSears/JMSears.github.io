Welcome to "Counseling, Performance, and Grievances."

00:00:02.902 --> 00:00:05.538
This module will provide you with a foundational

00:00:05.605 --> 00:00:08.408
understanding of some of the articles that are included in

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:12.612
the 2017 Master Agreement by and between the Department of

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:16.383
Veterans Affairs, or VA, and the National Association of

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:18.451
Government Employees, or NAGE.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:22.088
The articles covered in this module are listed on the screen.

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:25.492
These 20 articles are primarily concerned with matters of

00:00:25.558 --> 00:00:29.596
performance, advancement, and conduct that include job

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:32.832
classifications, competencies, promotion,

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:35.735
performance appraisals, counseling,

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:37.971
and disciplinary actions.

00:00:38.037 --> 00:00:41.040
In addition, some articles cover procedures for addressing

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:44.477
grievances or concerns on the part of the Department,

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:47.247
the Union, or the Employee.

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:50.250
After completing this module, you will be better prepared to

00:00:50.316 --> 00:00:52.919
effectively interpret these articles as they were intended

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:56.489
originally and avoid creating your own intent.

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:58.958
You will then feel more confident in following and

00:00:59.025 --> 00:01:01.995
complying with the articles when using them in the field.
