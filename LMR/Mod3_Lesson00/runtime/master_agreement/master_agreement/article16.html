<h1>ARTICLE 16 - OVERTIME</h1>

<div>

<h2>Section 1 - General Overtime Provisions</h2>

		<ol type="A">
		<li>Subject to and consistent with all federal laws, including but not limited to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended (29 USC 201, et seq.), the Federal Employees Pay Act (5 CFR Part 550, Part 551) and 38 USC 7422, 38 USC 7453, and 38 USC 7459.  Consistent with law and VA regulations this article does not apply to physicians, dentists, podiatrists, chiropractors and optometrists. </li>
		<li>The Department reserves the right to determine the qualifications required to work overtime. The Department will determine the number of employees needed to work overtime.</li>
		<li>If the Department requires overtime, employees are entitled to receive overtime pay.</li>
		<li>Overtime work shall be paid in accordance with applicable laws and regulations including, but not limited to, 5 CFR Part 551,Sub-part E. </li>
		<li>The purpose of this Article is to establish a process for the distribution of overtime that is fair and equitable. When making determinations on overtime assignments, the Department will give consideration to such factors as the character of the work, qualifications or professional competencies (as determined by the Department), availability and organizational location of employees, knowledge of the particular type of work involved and health/fatigue limitations. </li>
		<li>Employees shall be paid differential and premium pay in addition to the overtime compensation in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. </li>
		<li>It is agreed that non-bargaining unit employees shall not be scheduled on overtime to perform the duties of bargaining unit employees for the sole purpose of eliminating the need to schedule bargaining unit employees for overtime. </li>
		<li>The Department shall make a reasonable effort to give the employee as much notice as possible when planned overtime is required. If an employee is mandated to work overtime and has a conflict regarding the mandated overtime, the Department will give due consideration to the employee’s personal circumstances subject to the paramount requirement of fulfilling the mission of the Department. At the employee's request, the Department will endeavor to avoid mandated overtime exceeding four hours at the end of the employee's tour of duty.</li>
		<li>When the Department mandates unplanned overtime, employees are expected to work overtime. If an employee is mandated unplanned overtime, an employee may request release from an overtime assignment. The employee will be relieved when another qualified or competent employee (as determined by the Department) in the same work unit is readily available for the assignment and willing to work. The Department retains the right to direct an employee to work overtime consistent with Paragraph G above.</li>
		<li>Employees who are required to work overtime will be allowed to call at no cost and make necessary arrangements. This shall include but is not limited to dependent care arrangement and updates, medical appointments, classes and self- improvement commitments, etc. </li>
		<li>Those employees eligible by Title 5 or Title 38 can accrue and use compensatory time when approved by the Department. In accordance with 5 USC 2105, 5 USC 6122, 5 CFR 550.114 and 5 CFR 551.531, eligible employees may request in writing compensatory time off in lieu of premium pay for overtime work. The approving official will consider staffing and operational needs in the decision whether to approve compensatory time. Supervisors shall not require the above mentioned employees to take compensatory time in lieu of overtime pay. Appropriate officials or their designees, may, at the request of a GS or FWS employee on a flexible schedule, grant compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay, whether such overtime hours are regularly scheduled, irregular or occasional in nature. If the employee does not request compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay, or if the employee requests for compensatory time off in lieu of overtime pay is not granted, the employee shall be compensated for such overtime under the applicable statutory provisions. </li>
		<li>When the Department determines the need for voluntary overtime work, it is the discretion of the Department to offer voluntary compensatory time work, voluntary overtime work, or the option of either compensatory or overtime work. In each situation, it is the right of the employee to accept the offered work, decline or accept one of the two offered choices, as applicable.</li>
		<li>The Department shall, to the extent practicable, permit employees who earn compensatory time instead of overtime to use their compensatory time at the earliest time convenient to them within 26 pay periods. Normally, compensatory time off shall be granted before annual leave is approved. If annual leave would otherwise be forfeited, however, the annual leave shall be granted before compensatory time off. Any employee who is unable to use compensatory time within 26 pay periods will receive overtime pay instead. </li>
		<li>Employees who are called back to work for a period of overtime unconnected to their regularly scheduled tour or who work overtime on their day off, are entitled to a minimum of two hours overtime pay. Employees called in for emergency work outside their basic workweek shall not normally be required to perform non-emergency duties. </li>
		<li>When employees place their name on a voluntary roster, it is expected that the employee will perform the work when offered. Employees who do not perform the work (without just cause) may have their name moved to the bottom of the list, or be removed from the list for an appropriate period of time, to be determined by the Department at the local level after consultation with the Union.</li>
		<li>Overtime will be paid in 15 minute increments.</li>
		<li>Rosters of employees will be utilized to determine overtime, voluntary or mandatory. The Department will maintain records of overtime assignments in accordance with applicable laws and will, upon request, make the records available to the Local.</li>
 		<li>Employees required to work through their non-duty meal period shall be paid for such time. </li>
		<li>In the event of an extension of a regular tour of duty into an evening or night work shift for more than a three hour overtime work period, reasonable time will be allowed, when possible, for procurement and eating of food no later than three hours after the overtime starts. Employees not released from duty while eating will be compensated.</li>
