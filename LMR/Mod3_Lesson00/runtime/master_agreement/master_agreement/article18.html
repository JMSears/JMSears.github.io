<h1>ARTICLE 18 - TELEWORK</h1>

<div>

<h2>Section 1 - General</h2>

		<ol type="A">
		<li>The Department telework program will be governed by applicable law, government-wide rules and regulations, and VA policy. Any telework program established under this Article will be a voluntary program which permits employees to work at home or at other approved sites away from the office for all or a part of the work week. Federal telework programs are established primarily to meet the Department's mission and operational requirements. </li>
		<li>While telework is not an entitlement, the Department will consider an employee's request to participate in the Department's telework program consistent with law, government-wide regulations and VA policy. Telework is an arrangement established first and foremost to facilitate the accomplishment of work. </li>
		<li>Moreover, while telework should provide greater options to employees seeking to balance their work and family demands, telework may not be used for dependent or family care, nor may it be used to conduct other personal business while the employee is in an official duty status at an approved alternative duty station.</li>
		<li>If a duty to bargain is triggered under the Statute regarding the VA's telework program, the Department will provide notice and bargain as appropriate.</li>
		</ol>
</div>

		<li>All requests for telework will be submitted in writing using VA Form 0740. If after review, the request is denied, an explanation will be provided in writing to the employee in accordance with Section 3A above.</li>
		<li>If an employee's position is otherwise suitable for telework and an employee is a qualified individual with a disability or an employee has an approved claim from the Department of Labor Office of Workers Compensation for a work related injury, the employee may request to telework consistent with this Article. Nothing in this Article shall preclude the Department from offering telework in these situations.
