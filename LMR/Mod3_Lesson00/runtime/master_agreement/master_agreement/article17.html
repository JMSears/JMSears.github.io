</div>
<div>

<h2>Section 6 - Sick Leave for Title 5, Hybrid and Title 38 Employees</h2>
 
		<ol type="A">
		<li>Sick leave is an employee's earned benefit and will be granted to the employee for absences meeting the requirements of 5 CFR Section 630.401(a) (for Title 5 employees) or VA Handbook 5011, Part V, Chapter 3, which is not part of this negotiated agreement (for Title 38 employees).</li>
		<li>Consistent with 5 CFR Section 630.401(a), the Department must grant a Title 5 employee sick leave when the employee: </li>

				<ol type="1">
				<li>Receives medical, dental or optical examination or treatment; </li>
				<li>Is incapacitated for the performance of duties by physical or mental illness, injury, pregnancy or childbirth;</li>
				<li>Would, as determined by the health authorities having jurisdiction or by a health care provider, jeopardize the health of others by being present on duty after exposure to a contagious disease; or,</li>
				<li>Must be absent from duty for purposes relating to the adoption of a child, including appointments with adoption agencies, social workers, and attorneys; court proceedings; required travel; and any other activities necessary to allow the adoption to proceed.</li>
				</ol>

		<li>Consistent with VA Handbook 5011, Part V, Chapter 3, sick leave shall be granted to Title 38 employees when they are:</li>

				<ol type="1">
				<li>Incapacitated for the performance of their duties because of personal illness, disease, injury, pregnancy and confinement; </li>
				<li>For necessary medical, dental or optical examination or treatment; or,</li>
				<li>When a member of the immediate family of the employee is afflicted with a contagious disease and requires the care and attendance of the employee; or,</li>
				<li>When through exposure to contagious disease, the presence of the employee at the post of duty would jeopardize the health of others. </li>
				</ol>

		<li>It is the responsibility of an employee who is incapacitated for duty to notify the immediate supervisor or designee (or to have a responsible person make the notification for the employee) at a designated VA number as soon as possible, but not later than two hours after the employee is scheduled to report for duty unless mitigating circumstances exist. The supervisor will not routinely request the nature of the illness. </li>
		<li>An employee whose sick leave balance does not cover the absence requested may request the substitution of any leave available to him or her in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Such leave may be granted at the discretion of the supervisor. </li>
		<li>An employee who expects to be absent more than one day should inform the supervisor or designee of the expected date of return to duty and notify the supervisor of any change. In cases of extended illness, daily reports will not be required. </li>
		<li>The Parties will adhere to all laws and regulations as it is related to employees’ rights to privacy regarding sick leave documentation.</li>
		<li>The Department should make an effort to accommodate employees who request, in advance, a change in work schedule to meet medical or dental appointments. Employees will make reasonable efforts to schedule medical, dental or optical examination or treatment appointments after working hours or on non-workdays.</li>
		</ol>
</div>
<div>

<h2>Section 7 - Documentation of Sick Leave</h2>

		<ol type="A">
		<li>Sick leave for three workdays or less may be approved without a medical certificate. However, when the leave approving official has reason to believe that the employee is not incapacitated for duty, the leave approving official may require medical certificates for any period of absence in accordance with 5 CFR 630, Subpart D.</li>
		<li>An employee requesting sick leave, for periods of illness of more than three consecutive work days must make an appropriate request and may be required to furnish evidence of the need for sick leave within a reasonable period of time after return to duty. Employees who are required to provide a medical certificate or other evidence of illness to justify a sick leave request will be carried in an Absence Without Leave (AWOL) status until acceptable medical documentation is provided. AWOL is not a disciplinary action. It is a non-pay status that may form the basis for a disciplinary action. Medical certificates or other evidence of illness which may be required will be submitted within 15 days after the employee's return to duty. If, due to circumstances beyond the control of the employee, he or she is unable to provide the documentation within 15 calendar days, the employee must provide the evidence or medical certification no later than 30 calendar days after returning to work. An employee who does not provide the required evidence within 30 calendar days is not entitled to sick leave in accordance with 5 CFR 630.405(b).</li>
		<li>An employee can justify the request for sick leave by the following:</li>
 
 				<ol type="1">
				<li>By medical certification from the Department's personnel physician or the employee's personal physician or health care professional; </li>
				<li>By the employee's own written statement in instances where the illness was not treated by a physician. The statement will indicate why a physician was not seen, for example, remoteness of area, nature of illness, or other specific reasons. The supervisor may request clarification should the employee's written statement not be sufficient to support the request. </li>
				<li>An employee with chronic medical condition that does not require medical treatment, but does result in periodic absences from work, will not be required to furnish a physician's certificate on a continuing basis if the employee: </li>

						<ol type="a">
						<li>Is not on leave restriction; and,</li>
						<li>Provides, if requested, an updated valid medical certificate every six months which clearly states the continuing need for periodic absences. </li>
						</ol>
				
				<li>Medical certification must include a statement that the employee was incapacitated for work and date(s) of the incapacitation. This will be considered sufficient for medical certification purposes. This applies to both sick leave of more than three days and certification for sick leave restriction. However, employees will not be required to reveal the nature of the illness or injury. </li>
				<li>Regardless of whether an employee has been placed on a formal medical certification requirement, if for any reason an employee's medical certificate or other evidence of illness furnished is not considered satisfactory, the Department may require the employee to provide additional evidence in support of the employee's request for sick leave for any period of absence in accordance with 5 CFR 630.405.</li>
				</ol>

		<li>Information or documents regarding an employee's absence for sick leave purposes are highly sensitive. The Department will ensure that they are maintained in a secure and confidential manner. </li>
		</ol>
</div>
<div>

For the purposes of this paragraph, serious health condition has the same meaning as the definitions in 5 CFR 630.1202.</li>
		<li>If an employee previously has used any portion of the 104 hours of sick leave for general family care or bereavement purposes in a leave year, that amount must be subtracted from the 480 hour entitlement.</li>

				</ol>

						<li>If an employee has already used the maximum amount of sick leave permitted to care for a family member with a serious health condition, he or she cannot use additional hours in the same year for family care or bereavement purposes. </li>
						</ol>
			</ol>

		<li>Relation to Family and Medical Leave Act: </li>

				<ol type="1">

				<li>For the purposes of this paragraph, serious health condition has the same meaning as the definitions in 5 CFR 630.1202.</li>

The employee must be provided with the reasons in advance, in writing, why such requirement is being established in his or her case. All such cases requiring medical certification shall be reviewed not later than six months afterwards. Frequency or amount of leave used will not be the sole factor for determining sick leave abuse, nor will leave for which administratively acceptable medical documentation has been provided.</li>
		<li>When abuse ceases, the sick leave certification requirement will be removed, the record shall be made clean, and the employee will be notified of this action. The employee will also be notified of the reasons, in writing, if the certification requirements are to be continued. </li>

<div>

Under unusual circumstances, an employee can be excused up to a full day. Where release of an employee at the beginning or end of the day would seriously impair operations, the supervisor, to the extent possible, shall make other arrangements to allow the employee a reasonable amount of time during the workday to vote or register to vote. </p>

</div>
<div>

<h2>Section 12 - Compensatory Time Off for Travel</h2>

		<li>Upon return to duty after a period of LWOP, the Department will restore the employee to the position, which the employee held prior to the leave, or should no vacancy exist, to a similar position at the same grade and pay. </li>
		<li>Employees may request LWOP for educational purposes. </li>

<h2>Section 15 - Hazardous Weather/Emergency Conditions for Title 5, Hybrid and Title 38 Employees</h2>

		<ol type="A">
		<li>All employees of VA facilities provide critical services, and employees are required to be at work in emergency situations. Under certain circumstances the Department may excuse some of the employees. </li>
		<li>The Local shall be informed by the appropriate Department official at the time the facility declares hazardous weather/emergency conditions. The notification will be telephonic or e-mail.</li>
		<li>Early Dismissals: When the Department determines that emergency situations warrant, excused absence without charge to leave may be granted to employees who are in a duty status. Employees who are not in a duty status will be charged appropriate leave for the entire period of absence.</li>
		<li>When hazardous conditions (e.g., extreme weather conditions, serious interruptions in public transportation, earthquake and disasters such as flood, fire or other natural phenomena) arise, the Department will determine whether all or part of the facility should be closed or whether the facility should be open as usual. If the Department decides to close all or part of the facility during periods the facility would otherwise be open, the Department will notify employees whether telework in accordance with Article 18 - Telework, liberal leave or authorized absence will be authorized. Employees who are prevented from reporting to work due to the closure of all or part of a facility should be granted authorized absence or telework in accordance with Article 18 - Telework, OPM guidance and/or government-wide regulations. </li>
		<li>Absence Due to Emergency Situations: Excused absence during emergency situations does not generally apply to employees who provide critical services because of the need to assure continuity of essential patient care operations. However, in extreme situations, where certain employees who provide critical services make reasonable efforts to get to work and are unable to do so, excused absence may be appropriate.</li>
		<li>Whenever employees are unable to leave the facility at the end of their shifts due to inclement weather, or other emergency circumstances, the Department will review staffing needs to determine if any of these employees are required to perform duties during these emergency periods. If the employee is assigned work, the employee will be paid in accordance with established policy for the payment of premium rates. </li>
		<li>Employees who are unable to leave the facility at the end of their shifts due to inclement weather, or other emergency circumstances, and who remain at the facility shall be provided available shelter until such time as the emergency is over. </li>
		<li>The Department and the Local at each facility will jointly plan the procedures for hazardous weather/emergency conditions and will annually communicate these procedures to employees. </li>
		<li>When conditions are of such an extreme and unusual nature as to prevent employees from leaving an office, and the office must be staffed on a 24-hour basis during an emergency involving danger to human life and Federal property, VA may use funds to provide food to the affected employees.</li>

<h2>Section 16 - Religious Compensatory Time for Title 5, Hybrid and Title 38 Employees</h2>

		<ol type="A">
		<li>Pursuant to 5 CFR 550.1002, an employee whose personal religious beliefs require abstention from work during certain periods of time may elect to engage in overtime work to compensate for time lost when meeting those religious requirements.</li>
		<li>To the extent that such modifications in work schedules do not interfere with the efficient accomplishment of the Department's mission, the Department shall afford the employee the opportunity to work compensatory overtime and shall in each instance, grant compensatory time off to an employee requesting such time off for religious observances when the employee's personal religious beliefs require that the employee abstain from work during certain periods of the workday or workweek. </li>
		<li>For the purpose stated in paragraph B of this section, the employee may work such compensatory overtime before or after the granting of compensatory time off. Advanced compensatory time off should be repaid with the appropriate amount of compensatory overtime work within a reasonable amount of time. Compensatory overtime for hourly employees shall be credited on an hour-for-hour basis or authorized fractions thereof. Appropriate records will be kept of compensatory overtime earned and used. </li>
		<li>When an employee elects to perform overtime work to compensate for time lost meeting religious requirements, the employee will not be entitled to overtime pay under 5 CFR Part 550 and the Fair Labor Standards Act Section 7 for those time periods.</li>
		</ol>
</div>
<div>

<h2>Section 17 - Military Leave for Title 5, Hybrid and Title 38 Employees</h2>

		<ol type="A">
		<li>Military leave will be administered in accordance with law and regulations. The Department shall not deny an employee any benefit of employment on the basis of his or her membership in the National Guard or the Armed Forces Reserves. </li>
		<li>Employees whose appointments are not limited to one year or less, and who are members of the National Guard or the Armed Forces Reserves, are entitled to military leave for active duty, or active duty for training, in the following amounts:</li>

				<ol type="1">
				<li>Full-time Title 5 and full-time Title 38 employees are entitled to15 calendar days of regular military leave in a fiscal year. </li>
				<li>Part-time Title 38 employees are entitled to 15 calendar days of regular military leave in a fiscal year. </li>
				<li>Part-time Title 5 employees are entitled to no more than fifteen (15) calendar days of regular military leave in a fiscal year, prorated based on the number of hours in the employee's workweek. </li>
				</ol>

		<li>Any employee who does not use his or her entire entitlement of military leave can carry over any unused military leave (not to exceed 15 days) to the next fiscal year. Military leave may never exceed 30 days in a fiscal year, except when the employee is entitled to additional military leave under 5 USC 6323(b), (c), or (d). </li>
		<li>5 USC 6323(b) provides 22 workdays per calendar year for emergency duty as ordered by the President, the Secretary of Defense, or a State Governor. </li>
		<li>5 USC 6323(c) provides unlimited military leave to members of the National Guard of the District of Columbia for certain types of duty ordered or authorized under Title 39 of the District of Columbia Code. </li>
		<li>For employees who are charged leave in one-day increments, the minimum charge to military leave is one day. For all other employees, the minimum charge to leave is one hour. Military leave should be credited to a full-time employee on the basis of an eight-hour workday. </li>
		<li>An employee may be charged military leave only for hours that the employee would otherwise have worked and received pay. For example, if an employee works for the Department on a Monday-Friday schedule with weekends off, and the employee is scheduled for military duty Friday through Monday, the employee is charged military leave only for Friday and Monday, not for the weekend days. </li>
		<li>The Department will take into consideration the schedules of employees who work off-tours and will, when possible, arrange schedules to allow such employees to have scheduled days off immediately preceding and following the required military leave.</li>
		<li>A Title 5 employee's pay remains the same for periods of military leave under 5 USC 6323(a) and (c), including any premium pay the employee would have received if not on military leave. For military leave under 5 USC 6323(b), the employee's civilian pay is reduced by the amount of military pay for the day of military leave. However, employees may choose not to take the military leave and instead take annual leave and keep both the military and civilian pay. </li>
		<li>Military leave for Title 38 employees is subject to VA Handbook 5011, Part III, Chapter 3, paragraph 7 which is not part of this negotiated agreement and provided for informational purposes only.</li>
		<li>When the Department is given at least two weeks advance notice, and when there are qualified employees available to perform the necessary work, the Department will make every effort to provide, through advance scheduling, days off for employees in the bargaining unit to attend weekend training drills. If, because of an operational need, the Department is unable to schedule time for the employee to attend weekend training drills, the Department will make every effort to afford the employee an alternative work schedule within the administrative workweek to prevent loss of pay or other benefits. </li>
		<li>The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 generally requires the Department to place an employee entering the military on LWOP unless the employee chooses to be placed on military leave or annual leave, or the employee requests to be separated. Additionally, the Department will comply with all USERRA requirements upon an employee's return from mobilization.</li>
		<li>The Department will not arbitrarily deny an employee's request for military leave.</li>
		<li>Employees Returning From Active Duty. In accordance with the Presidential Memorandum dated November 14, 2003, as a welcome home, returning Federal Civil servants who were called to active duty in the Global War on Terrorism will be granted 5 days of excused absence for every deployment. </li>

<h2>Section 23 - Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)</h2>

		<ol type="A">
		<li>FMLA pursuant to 5 USC 6381 et seq.:</li>

				<ol type="1">
				<li>Under the FMLA permanent bargaining unit employees who have completed at least 12 months of service are entitled to up to 480 hours of LWOP during any twelve month period for one or more of the following reasons:</li>

						<ol type="a">
						<li>The care of a spouse, son, daughter or parent with a serious health condition;</li>
						<li>A serious health condition of the employee that makes the employee unable to perform any one or more of the essential functions of his or her assigned position;</li>
						<li>Birth of a son or daughter and the care of such son or daughter; or,</li>
						<li>Placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption or foster care;</li>
						<li>Any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a covered military member on "covered active duty;" or, </li>
						<li>26 workweeks of leave during a single 12-month period to care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness if the eligible employee is the service member's spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin (military caregiver leave).</li>

						<ol type="a">
						<li>Birth of a son or daughter and the care of such son or daughter (provided such son or daughter is under 18 years of age or incapable of self-care because of a medical or physical disability); or,</li>

		<li>Pursuant to the President's June 17, 2009 Memorandum on Federal Benefits and Non-Discrimination, the OPM expanded employee eligibility to use sick leave. In the spirit of this change, the employer will grant up to 480 hours of LWOP during any twelve month period to permanent bargaining unit employees who have completed at least 12 months of service to care for "[a]ny individual related by blood or affinity'' whose close association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship, if the employee is ineligible for FMLA pursuant to A above solely upon the basis that the family member requiring the care does not meet the definition of family member in 5 USC 6381. If an employee has used any portion of LWOP pursuant to paragraph A above, the employee's eligibility for leave under this paragraph will be reduced.</li>
		<li>An employee may not retroactively invoke his or her entitlement to family and medical leave. However, if an employee was physically or mentally incapable of invoking the entitlement during the entire period he or she was absent for work for a qualifying reason, the employee may invoke the entitlement within two workdays after returning to work. Such incapacity must be documented by a written medical certification from a health care provider.</li>
		<li>Employees may only take the amount of family and medical leave necessary to manage the circumstances that prompted the need for the leave.</li>
		<li>Holidays do not count against the maximum entitlement to family and medical leave.</li>
		<li>Substitution of Paid Leave - Employees may substitute annual leave, compensatory time off, or credit hours for unpaid family or medical leave for any part of the applicable period. Additionally, sick leave may be used but only to the extent allowed by law and government-wide regulations. However, once the leave commences, employees may not retroactively substitute paid time off for unpaid family and medical leave.</li>
		<li>Notice of Leave</li>

				<ol type="1">
				<li>When the need for unpaid family and medical leave is foreseeable and the employee fails to give 30 calendar days notice, the Department may require the employee to delay taking family and medical unpaid leave until at least 30 calendar days after the employee's request has been received. Examples include family and medical leave for an expected birth of a child, expected placement for adoption or foster care, or planned medical treatment. If the birth or placement or planned medical treatment requires leave to begin within 30 days, the employee must provide as much notice as is practicable.</li>
				<li>If leave taken under Paragraph A above is foreseeable, the employee shall consult with the Department and make a reasonable effort to schedule medical treatment so as to not disrupt the Department's operations, subject to the approval of the authorized health care provider.</li>
				<li>If the leave is not foreseeable, the employee or his or her personal representative (e.g., family member or other responsible party) shall provide notice within a reasonable period of time appropriate to the circumstances involved.</li>
				<li>The Department may require that a request for leave under this section be supported by evidence that is administratively acceptable. </li>
				</ol>

		<li>Medical Certification (when requesting leave for serious health conditions):</li>

				<ol type="1">
				<li>An employee shall provide written medical certification, signed by the health care provider, no later than 15 calendar days after the Department has requested such certification. If it is not practicable under the circumstances to provide the certification despite the employee's diligent good faith efforts, the employee must provide the certification within a reasonable period of time, but no later than 30 calendar days after the Department has requested the certification.</li>
				<li>The written medical certification shall include:</li>

						<li>The appropriate medical facts, within the knowledge of the health care provider, regarding the serious health condition, including a statement as to the incapacitation, examination, or treatment that may be required by an authorized health care provider;</li>
						<li>For the purposes of leave taken to care for a family member, a statement from the authorized health care provider that the relative by blood or affinity of the employee requires psychological comfort and/or physical care; needs assistance for basic medical, hygienic, nutritional, safety, or transportation or in making arrangements to meet such needs, and that the family member would benefit from the employee's care or presence. The employee will also provide a statement of the care he or she will provide and an estimate of the amount of time needed to care for his or her relative by blood or affinity; </li>
						<li>A statement that the employee is unable to perform the functions of his/her position; and</li>
						<li>In the case of intermittent leave or leave on a reduced schedule, for planned medical treatment, the dates (actual or estimates) on which the treatment is expected to be given, the duration of such treatments, and the period of recovery, if any, or specify that the serious health condition is a chronic or continuing condition with an unknown duration and whether the patient is presently incapacitated and the likely duration and frequency of episodes of incapacity.</li>

								<ol type="i">
								<li>At its own expense, the Department may require subsequent medical recertification on a periodic basis, but not more than once every 30 calendar days, for leave taken for purposes related to pregnancy, chronic conditions, or long-term conditions meeting the definition of serious health care condition in 5 CFR 630.1202.</li>
								<li>The Department will not require any personal or confidential information in the written medical certification other than that required by this Section and the law.</li>
								<li>To remain entitled to leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, an employee or family member must comply with any the Department requirement that they submit to examination (not treatment) to obtain a second or third medical certification from a health care provider other than the individual's health care provider.</li>
								<li>If the employee is unable to provide the requested medical certification before leave begins or the Department questions the validity of the original certification provided by the employee, and the medical treatment requires the leave to begin, the Department shall grant provisional leave pending final written medical certification.</li>
								<li>If the employee does not provide the required certification, such leave may not be taken under the Family and Medical Leave Act. The Department may charge the employee absence without leave or allow the employee to take annual leave, sick leave, or leave without pay, as appropriate.</li>

				<li>Leave taken for a serious health condition of this section may be taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule subject to the notice and certification requirements in paragraphs H and I, respectively.</li>
				<li>If an employee takes leave intermittently or on a reduced schedule, which is foreseeable based on planned medical treatment or recovery from a serious health condition, the Department may place the employee temporarily in an available alternative position for which the employee is qualified and that can better accommodate recurring periods of leave.</li>
				</ol>

		<li>An employee eligible for FMLA may request to participate in the Telework Program consistent with this Agreement. Telework may not be used to provide care for a family member during scheduled work hours.</li>

<h2>Section 25 - Blood, Bone Marrow and Organ Donor Leave</h2>

		<ol type="A">
		<li>Donor leave will be granted consistent with government-wide rules and regulations.</li>

		<li>Upon request, subject to certification by a health care provider, leave-approving officials shall approve excused absence for employees who serve as living donors for bone marrow, organ, and tissue donation and transplantation. The use of excused absence can cover time off for activities such as donor screening, the actual medical procedure, and recovery time. Leave-approving officials shall approve: </li>

				<ol type="1">
				<li>Up to seven workdays of absence without charge to leave or loss of pay for each donation by employees participating as living bone marrow donors; or, </li>
				<li>Up to 30 workdays of absence without charge to leave or loss of pay for employees participating as living organ and tissue donors.</li>
