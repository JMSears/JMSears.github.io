<h2>Section 3 - Procedure for Filing Claims for Workers' Compensation Benefits</h2>

		<ol type="A">

		<li>The following publications are provided as information to assist employees  in the filing of an OWCP claim:</li>

				<ol type="1">
				<li>Publication CA-810:  Injury Compensation For Federal Employees</li>
				<li>Publication CA-550:  "Questions and Answers about Federal Employees Compensation Act (FECA)"</li>
				</ol>

		<li>The employee who sustains a job related injury or illness has the responsibility to inform their appropriate supervisor as soon as possible. If the employee is incapacitated, this action may be taken by someone acting on behalf of the employee. </li>
		<li>The Department shall, at that time, assure the employee is provided the proper forms and assist the employee in filling them out.  The CA-16, CA-17, CA-7, and CA-20 must be in hard copy; for other forms, the employee will be permitted to choose whether to use electronic or paper forms.  </li>
		<li>At the time the employee files a claim, the employee will be asked to designate whether he or she wishes a representative of the Union to be notified that the employee has filed a claim, and/or to receive a copy of the claim. </li>
		<li>The law provides that a claim for compensation must be filed within three years of the injury or death. Even if a claim is not filed within three years, however, compensation may still be allowed if written notice of injury was given within 30 days or the immediate supervisor had actual knowledge of the injury or death within 30 days after occurrence. This knowledge may consist of written records or verbal notification.  An entry into an employee's medical record may also satisfy this requirement, if the data is sufficient to place the agency on notice of a possible work-related injury or illness. </li>
 		<li>Employees and supervisors are responsible for filling out the appropriate forms and adhering to OWCP time frames.</li>
		<li>Employees will not be required by the Department officials to release medical records or personally identifiable information except in accordance with DOL requirements. The release of such information will assist the Department in its ability to find temporary placement consistent with the employee's limitations.</li>
		<li>All records relating to claims for benefits filed under FECA are covered by the government-wide Privacy Act system of records (DOL\Govt 1) (See 20 CFR 10.11).  The Department will ensure the privacy, security and confidentiality of medical records. Notification and release will be consistent with Article 38 - Official Records.</li>

		<li>An employee with a job-related traumatic injury may elect to receive 45 days of COP if the claim is filed within 30 days of the injury.  The entitlement to COP is not available to employees who file an occupational disease claim. </li>
		<li>Pending the approval of the compensation claim, an employee with a job-related traumatic injury or occupational disease may elect to be placed on sick or annual leave instead of leave without pay.  If the employee's claim is approved, the employee shall have the option of buying back any paid leave used and having it reinstated to the employee's account.</li>
		<li>If the employee's claim for compensation is disallowed by the DOL, OWCP, any of the 45 days of COP that were previously granted will be converted to sick leave and annual leave.  The employee shall be responsible for advising the Department as to which form(s) of leave is/are requested and for completing an SF-71, Application for Leave, or its electronic equivalent.</li>

<h2>Section 8 - FECA Definitions Provided for Informational Purposes Only</h2>

		<ol type="A">
		<li>CA-1 is the appropriate form for reporting a traumatic injury.  A traumatic injury is a wound or other condition of the body caused by external force, including stress or strain.  The injury must be identifiable by time and place of occurrence and member of the body affected; it must be caused by a specific event or incident or series of events or incidents within a single day or work shift.  A traumatic injury also includes damage to or destruction of prosthetic devices or appliances. </li>
		<li>CA-2 is the appropriate form for reporting an occupational disease or illness.  An occupational disease is defined as a condition produced in the work environment over a period longer than one workday or shift.  It may result from systemic infection, repeated stress or strain, exposure to toxins, poisons, or fumes, or other continuing conditions of the work. </li>
		<li>CA-2A is the appropriate form for recording a recurrence of disability.  A recurrence of disability is defined as a spontaneous return or increase of disability due to a previous injury or occupational disease without intervening cause or a return or increase of disability due to a consequential injury (defined as one which occurs due to weakness or impairment caused by a work related injury). </li>
		<li>CA-16 authorizes an injured employee to obtain immediate examination and/or treatment from a physician for an on-the-job injury.  An employee has the initial right to select a physician of his or her choice to provide necessary treatment.  The physician must be listed by name on the CA-16.  The term 'physician' includes doctors of medicine (MD), surgeons, osteopathic practitioners, podiatrists, dentists, clinical psychologists, optometrists, and chiropractors within the scope of their practice as defined by state law.  Whenever possible, the employee will be provided CA-16 (Authorization for Examination and/or Treatment) within four hours after requesting the CA-16.  When it is not possible, the Department will authorize medical treatment by telephone and send the completed form to the medical facility within 48 hours.  The Department will provide the employee with information about accessing DOL's online medical provider search tool and will assist the employee in obtaining the list.  The fact that a provider is listed in no way constitutes an endorsement of the provider, or the provider's services, by the Department. </li>
		<li>CA-17 is the form used to report the duty status of the employee.  The  applicable Department official must fill out the left hand portion of the form describing the physical requirements of the position.  The physician or practitioner completes the CA-17, Duty Status Report, as appropriate, to provide information such as the date the employee can return to work or any restrictions on work the employee will be able to perform.</li>
		<li>CA-7 is the form used to claim compensation (wage loss) when the employee cannot return to work after Continuation of Pay (COP) ends, or when the employee is not entitled to receive COP, and claims compensation for wage loss.  CA-7 is filed in occupational exposure or recurrence cases.  In controverted cases, where pay is terminated, form CA-7 is submitted with form CA-1.  CA-7 is also used to claim a schedule award for permanent impairment as a result of traumatic injury. </li>
		<li>CA-20 is a Medical Report Form.  This report may be made on CA-20, which is a form attached to CA-7.  The Department will provide form CA-20 to the employee as often as needed.</li>
