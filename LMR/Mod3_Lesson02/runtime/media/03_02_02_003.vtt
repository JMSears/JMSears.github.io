00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:03.236
The Rater develops and communicates an individualized

00:00:03.303 --> 00:00:06.806
performance plan to each Employee that includes critical

00:00:06.873 --> 00:00:09.743
and non-critical performance elements.

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.713
These elements correspond to the assignments or responsibilities

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.182
of the Employee's position.

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:19.586
The performance plan also uses performance standards to measure

00:00:19.652 --> 00:00:23.289
how well the Employee performs each element.

00:00:23.356 --> 00:00:26.926
Performance standards may include, but are not limited to,

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:32.232
quality, quantity, timeliness, and manner of performance.

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:35.568
Performance standards must be related to the Employee's

00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:38.805
position description or functional statement.
