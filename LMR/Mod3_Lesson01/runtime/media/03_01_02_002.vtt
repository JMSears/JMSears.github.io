During a routine counseling session,

00:00:02.502 --> 00:00:04.838
a Supervisor might ask an Employee questions.

00:00:04.904 --> 00:00:08.541
This session can also turn into a meeting where the Employee has

00:00:08.608 --> 00:00:11.945
a right to request Union representation when the Employee

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:14.114
reasonably believes the questions may lead to

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.451
discipline, and the Employee requests Union representation.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:20.887
If the Employee requests representation,

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:24.724
the questioning should stop until a Union Representative can be present.
