00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.203
The rules for retaining a written counseling are different

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:06.973
for an Employee who was hired on a probationary basis.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.476
A counseling record can be retained until the time a

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:12.879
decision is made whether to continue the Employee beyond the

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:14.948
probationary period.

00:00:15.014 --> 00:00:17.751
The counseling can be retained longer if the Employee is

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:19.753
separated and files an appeal.

00:00:19.819 --> 00:00:23.790
In this event, the written counseling may be retained while

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.859
the separation is appealed.
