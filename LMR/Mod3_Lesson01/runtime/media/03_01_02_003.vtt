It is also a responsibility of the Supervisor to inform an

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.074
Employee when he or she may be entitled to a Union Representative.

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:11.177
As soon as a Supervisor becomes aware that he or she is going to

00:00:11.244 --> 00:00:14.080
ask a question that could lead to discipline,

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:17.384
the Supervisor must advise the Employee of the right to have

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.452
Union representation.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.055
This could be before a meeting or during one.

00:00:22.122 --> 00:00:26.226
If the Employee wants to have a Union Representative present,

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:29.095
the questioning must stop until this is arranged.
