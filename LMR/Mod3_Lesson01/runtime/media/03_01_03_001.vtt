00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:03.803
Article 8 also describes rules surrounding how long records

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.905
from counseling may be kept.

00:00:05.972 --> 00:00:09.142
These rules most obviously apply to written counseling,

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:12.278
as that writing is itself a record.

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:15.548
These rules for record keeping also apply if a Supervisor

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:19.519
records the contents of an oral counseling in writing.

00:00:19.586 --> 00:00:23.022
These records can be as simple as a Supervisor making a written

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.426
notation that an oral counseling session occurred.
