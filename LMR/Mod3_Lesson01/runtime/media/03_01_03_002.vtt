00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:03.536
When a Supervisor gives an Employee a written counseling,

00:00:03.603 --> 00:00:06.973
he or she must provide the Employee with two copies and

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.808
retain a copy as a record.

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:12.545
The rules for the Supervisor retaining a copy depend on

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:15.315
whether the counseling was used to warn the Employee about

00:00:15.382 --> 00:00:17.183
misconduct or performance.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.920
If the record of counseling concerns misconduct,

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:24.124
it can only be retained six months for supporting

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:28.628
disciplinary or adverse action taken under Article 37.

00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:31.097
If there is no additional related misconduct on the

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:35.769
Employee's part, the counseling record must be removed in six months.

00:00:35.835 --> 00:00:38.972
However, if there is additional related misconduct,

00:00:39.038 --> 00:00:42.342
the six-month limit is extended to one year.

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:44.911
A written counseling to warn the Employee about his or her

00:00:44.978 --> 00:00:48.448
performance uses a time frame for retention connected to the

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:51.985
appeal period for the annual performance rating.

00:00:52.051 --> 00:00:54.921
If the record is for performance counseling with no personnel

00:00:54.988 --> 00:01:00.093
action taken, it may only be kept until the end of the appeal period.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.929
If the counseling record is used to support a timely personnel

00:01:02.996 --> 00:01:06.633
action taken during the performance period or a timely

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:09.068
action based on the Employee's rating,

00:01:09.135 --> 00:01:12.605
it can be kept beyond the annual performance appeal period.
