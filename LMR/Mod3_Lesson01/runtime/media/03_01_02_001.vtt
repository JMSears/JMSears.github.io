00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.969
Counseling can be either oral or written.

00:00:03.036 --> 00:00:06.072
Oral counseling takes place in a private conversation between a

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:08.775
Department Official, most likely a Supervisor,

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:12.812
and an Employee to encourage the Employee to improve his or her

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.249
conduct or deficiency in performance.

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:18.852
When does a routine oral counseling session turn into a

00:00:18.918 --> 00:00:21.354
meeting where the Employee has the right to Union

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:23.089
Representation?

00:00:23.156 --> 00:00:25.725
This can happen when more than one Department Official will be

00:00:25.792 --> 00:00:28.094
involved in a counseling session.

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:31.831
Then the meeting becomes more formal in nature.

00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:35.268
In this instance, the Employee must be notified in advance and

00:00:35.335 --> 00:00:38.471
advised of his or her right to have Union representation.
