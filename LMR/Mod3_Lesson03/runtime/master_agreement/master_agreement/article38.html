The employee, or their union representative, may request that any applicable timeframes for a related action may be extended or held in abeyance.  </li>

When a request for access involves medical or psychological records that the Systems Administrator, or designee, believes requires special handling, the requester should be advised that the material will be provided only to an authorized healthcare provider designated by the employee. Upon receipt of the designation and upon verification of such provider, the records will be made available to the provider, who will have full authority to disclose those records to the employee, when appropriate.
