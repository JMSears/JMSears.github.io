<h2>Section 1 - General </h2>

		<ol type="A">
		<li>38 USC Chapter 74 provides the Secretary of Veterans Affairs with authority to hire personnel listed in 38 USC 7401 directly, without regard to civil service hiring requirements. The Department may fill these positions without posting vacancy announcements. If the Department elects to post a vacancy announcement, it may simultaneously post such positions internally and externally.</li>
		<li>When the Department elects to post a vacancy announcement, it will be posted for 10 calendar days. However, when there is evidence of a critical staffing shortage or a lack of qualified internal candidates, the Department may fill the position prior to the expiration date of the announcement and will notify the Local.</li>
		<li>Once a selection has been made, the Local may request a list of those who have applied for a specific position.</li>
		</ol>
</div>
<div>

<h2>Section 2 - Contents of Vacancy Announcement</h2>

<p>When the Department elects to post a vacancy announcement, the qualifications for the position and the educational/certification level will be kept current and clearly defined on the vacancy announcement. If the requirements of the job/position change, the vacancy announcement will be reposted reflecting the changes. </p>
