<h2>Section 2 - Representation</h2>

<p>Consistent with VA policy:</p>

		<ol type="A">
		<li>When an employee is the subject of a Title 38 Disciplinary Appeals Board (DAB), the employee is entitled to designate a personal (non-union) representative of their choice, who may be from the Local.  The personal representative is not representing the Local and cannot use official time. The personal representative must protect the confidentiality of any information to which they have access in connection with the DAB hearing. A representative in a DAB hearing may speak, clarify, ask questions, and present the interests of the employee for whom they represent. However, the representative may not unnecessarily interfere with or delay the proceeding.</li>
		<li>If the employee does not choose to have representation, the Local will be permitted to have a non-participatory observer present at the DAB. The union observer will be on official time, consistent with Article 6 - Official Time. The union observer may attend the hearing only during the bargaining unit employee's presentation. The observer must protect the confidentiality of any information to which they have access in connection with the board hearing.</li>
		<li>When an employee is the subject of a Summary Review Board (SRB), the employee is entitled to a representative of their choice, provided the choice would not create a conflict of interest. The representative must protect the confidentiality of any information to which they have access in connection with the SRB hearing. A representative in a SRB hearing may speak, clarify, ask questions, and present the interests of the employee for whom they represent. However, the representative may not unnecessarily interfere with or delay the proceeding. The union representative may attend the hearing only during the bargaining unit employee's presentation.</li>
