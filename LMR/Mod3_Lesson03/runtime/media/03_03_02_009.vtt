00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:03.203
First, the Employee files the appeal with appropriate

00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:06.973
Department Officials at the Veterans Affairs Central Office, or VACO.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.946
This can be done with assistance from local HR and Union Representatives.

00:00:13.012 --> 00:00:17.617
HR staff will forward the appeal to VACO no later than 15 days

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:20.754
after the Employee submits it to them.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.957
VACO Officials will generally complete their review within 60

00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:26.960
days of the date they receive the appeal.

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:29.729
The Employee who filed the classification appeal is

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:34.033
entitled to a copy of the classification appeal file.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.370
The Local can also request and receive a copy of this file.

00:00:37.437 --> 00:00:41.641
If the Employee is satisfied with the response from VACO,

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:42.709
the process ends.

00:00:42.776 --> 00:00:46.646
If the Employee is not satisfied with the response from VACO

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:51.384
officials, he or she may seek a classification review from OPM.
