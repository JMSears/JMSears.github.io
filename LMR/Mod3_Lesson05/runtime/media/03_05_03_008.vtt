00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:03.069
If an Employee is not improving after receiving appropriate

00:00:03.136 --> 00:00:06.339
assistance, the Department may apply measures based on his or

00:00:06.406 --> 00:00:10.009
her performance failing to meet promotion criteria.

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:13.179
This is provided the Employee is not on probation.

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:16.216
The Department may provide the Employee additional time to meet

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:19.619
the promotion criteria; or assign the Employee duties

00:00:19.686 --> 00:00:22.822
commensurate with the current grade.

00:00:22.889 --> 00:00:26.826
If the second action is taken, the Career Ladder Plan may end,

00:00:26.893 --> 00:00:29.429
and the Employee will remain at the level he or she reached

00:00:29.496 --> 00:00:31.664
within the career ladder.

00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:34.134
If the Employee remains in the position,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.337
he or she may be non-competitively reinstated in

00:00:37.404 --> 00:00:40.940
the career ladder plan or assigned to another position at

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:42.509
the same grade and step.
