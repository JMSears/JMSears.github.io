00:00:00.233 --> 00:00:03.036
What happens next depends on whether the Employee is making

00:00:03.103 --> 00:00:06.573
progress toward meeting the criteria for promotion.

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:08.808
When the Employee is making progress,

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:12.145
the Supervisor will ensure that the Employee has the opportunity

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:16.216
to acquire needed skills and knowledge as soon as possible,

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:20.987
and to demonstrate that he or she meets performance promotion requirements.

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:24.224
If either the Employee or Supervisor recognizes that the

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.461
Employee needs assistance to meet the criteria for advancing,

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:32.665
they will develop an individualized plan to help the Employee.

00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:35.635
The plan should include all applicable training and any

00:00:35.702 --> 00:00:38.004
other appropriate support.

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:41.274
The Union Local may assist at the Employee's request.
