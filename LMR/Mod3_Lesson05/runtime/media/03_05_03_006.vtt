00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:03.737
Article 26 also has provisions for the Employee who does not

00:00:03.803 --> 00:00:07.207
meet the Fully Successful or higher performance criteria for

00:00:07.273 --> 00:00:08.775
a promotion.

00:00:08.842 --> 00:00:10.744
When this happens, the Department will give the

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.781
Employee a written notice at least 60 calendar days prior to

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:18.218
the earliest date of promotion eligibility.

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:21.254
The written notice will state what he or she needs to do to

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:25.625
meet performance criteria for the career ladder promotion plan.

00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:28.862
However, career ladder plans or positions that require a

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:32.198
three-month training period do not require the Department to

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:35.101
send 60-calendar-day notices.

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:38.571
In this instance, the Department will provide the required notice

00:00:38.638 --> 00:00:42.509
to the Employee in a reasonable period prior to the earliest

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:44.644
date of promotion eligibility.
