00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.269
When the Department knows in advance that a lack of available

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:06.706
work or funds may pose problems for a promotion,

00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:10.110
the Department should notify the affected Employee before the

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:11.978
end-of-year discussion.

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:14.881
This would be the end of the Employee's year in grade.

00:00:14.948 --> 00:00:18.518
For example, the Employee could be eligible for promotion in

00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:23.623
April even though the performance year ends on September 30th.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.459
The Department will discuss the rationale for not promoting the

00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:28.862
Employee based on work constraints,

00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:35.101
funding constraints, or both, with the Employee and the Local Union.

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:38.605
Within seven calendar days, the Department will also provide the

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:42.208
Employee and the Local with a written notice explaining why

00:00:42.275 --> 00:00:44.677
the Employee is not going to be promoted.
