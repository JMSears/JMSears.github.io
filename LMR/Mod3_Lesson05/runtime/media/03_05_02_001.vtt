00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:03.603
Section 3 defines a career ladder as a series of positions

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.940
of increasing difficulty, in the same line of work,

00:00:07.006 --> 00:00:10.043
that an Employee may progress through from the entry level to

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.445
the full-performance level.

00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:15.348
The full performance level is the highest-grade level that an

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:18.918
Employee can be promoted to non-competitively within the

00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:20.687
career ladder.

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:24.791
The entire progression is documented in a career ladder plan.

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:28.094
An Employee's Supervisor can share the plan with him or her.
