00:00:00.767 --> 00:00:04.437
An Employee is not automatically promoted in a career ladder.

00:00:04.504 --> 00:00:09.376
The intent is to provide him or her with opportunity for advancement.

00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:12.379
The Employee starts at an entry level position that requires

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:14.080
basic skills.

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:17.684
Over time, the Employee receives training and assignments of more

00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:20.720
complex work at each position level.

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:24.290
This means that as an Employee successfully completes more

00:00:24.357 --> 00:00:28.194
advanced duties, the career ladder enables him or her to

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:30.663
continue assuming a broader range of duties.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.601
For each level on the ladder, the Department informs the

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:37.737
Employee of his or her responsibilities using a

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:42.675
position description or a career ladder plan tailored to the position.

00:00:42.742 --> 00:00:45.478
Whenever the Department revises an Employee's career ladder

00:00:45.545 --> 00:00:49.015
plan, the Employee will be provided a copy of the revised

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:52.318
plan within 30 calendar days of the revision.
